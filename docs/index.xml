      <title>We should write notes (for life lessons)</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/post/we-should-write-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/post/we-should-write-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my JEE preparations, I used to make a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of notes. Everyone did. Our Physics teacher was a storyteller. His stories used to make me wonder. I used to write them down as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied for two years. Thus, it was very important to write things down and keep revising. It was impossible to remember the lessons we learnt, without making good notes. My academic journey is about to end with my graduation. I realize I would not be making any notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I was listening to an amazing podcast called &lt;a href=&#34;https://secularbuddhism.com/episodes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Secular Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;. One of the episodes made my day. I need to remember the concept in the future as well. But, I am sure I will forget this in a month or earlier. This is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We should be making non-academic notes as well&lt;/strong&gt;. The podcast episode was like a lesson, and it is a very good idea to write it down. The writing process will also add clarity to my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have conversations daily. We experience many things. We read books. We meditate. We observe things silently. All this time, we learn something, the quality and amount of which is subjective. Sometimes, we ponder over one thought for days to understand it upto satistication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other lesson, we should keep re-visiting these thoughts. This is necessary to generate value for our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an incredible case of note taking. There is no ultimate exam. Yet, some days may create an illusion of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Geniune Love and Infatuation</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/post/love-and-infatuation/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/post/love-and-infatuation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long time, I read something so meaningful on reddit. &lt;strong&gt;How do you distinguish genuine love for someone from infatuation?&lt;/strong&gt; was the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to quote what I read and later express some of my thoughts on the subject. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/aedq0v/how_do_you_distinguish_genuine_love_for_someone/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here is the original comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; It’s really easy to confuse it with genuine love. But for me anyway, infatuation is a lot more like a drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a feeling that consumes you with temporary euphoric highs, and deep, dark lows. It’s almost like a panicked state of obsession. It fills your brain so all you can think about is that person. You start to care less about what really matters in your own life&amp;hellip;your goals, your friends, your work. All that matters when you’re infatuated, is them. And you feel a strong, leeching desire to mold yourself into the person you think they’d want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re infatuated with someone, when that person gets closer to you in any way, you feel a rush. Like you’re on cloud 9. Like you just popped a bunch of really good ecstasy. And it feels amazing in the moment. But then when you sense them distancing from you in any way&amp;hellip;an ignored text. A rescheduled date. Flirting with another person. Going out on the town without you. Whatever. It feels like the world is crumbling&amp;hellip;like you’re going through a withdrawal. You panic and fear you’re going to lose them. There’s a constant push/pull. In those moments of panic all you care about is pulling them back to you. Those up and downs can be maddening over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, I think infatuation is latching onto the idealized picture your brain paints of someone. &amp;hellip; You feel in love with them even though you barely know what’s it like to really be with them. &amp;hellip; You start thinking crazy thoughts like “this person is perfect”&amp;hellip;”this person is the solution to all of my problems, if I can just keep them I’ll be fulfilled”&amp;hellip;”if I can’t have this person I’ll never be genuinely happy”. You think you’re madly in love. But it’s all shallow. Once that person actually starts getting closer to you&amp;hellip;the infatuation can wear off pretty quickly&amp;hellip;and you can be left feeling confused and deflated. Like a spent firework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most “love at first sight”, and honeymoon periods is really just infatuation. It can turn into love, but it’s not really. And sometimes if you’re not careful, it can blind you and drag you down into some really dark places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love on the other hand, is a lot more comfortable. It’s less erratic. It grows slowly over time and stays pretty constant. Its the general feeling of caring and warmth towards someone. You can hate someone in a current moment, but still love them overall. You can find someone to be unattractive, or incompatible&amp;hellip;and still love them deep down. You can have a fight with the person you love, and not fear you’re going to lose them&amp;hellip;you just want to revolve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not like a drug&amp;hellip;it doesn’t have the highs and lows of infatuation. Its gotta be cultivated and nurtured. You don’t lose yourself in it, or have the drive to turn into the person they want you to be&amp;hellip;love helps you find yourself, and drives you to become the person you want to be. Love for a partner isn’t too different than the love you feel for a blood relative. It can be subtle and mellow&amp;hellip;sometimes barely recognizable&amp;hellip;but it’s always there. You’re connected to them at a deep primal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left me thinking for some time. Some of my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have little control over our Infatuation, but Love is a practice&lt;/strong&gt;. It is comforting to know that love is not a fixed biological property which is set since birth. It is so much about our choices. We can learn to love and become one with it. We can teach people to practice love. Infact, there exists a very profoud meditation technique called &amp;ldquo;Loving-Kindness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People can sometimes fall in love with their infatuation but never the person&lt;/strong&gt;. This is so interesting to think about! This can give someone a feeling of being in love. But as the infatuation fades, the love fades as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infatuation is not bad at all&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s as if, infatuation is our survival mechanism. But love goes beyond just surviving. It is spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love is not an emotion&lt;/strong&gt;. Happiness and Sadness come in phases. They are emotions. But love is always present, in us. Our mind may get distracted sometimes. (This is whole another perception, which I felt in one experience.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love is very fundamental and not complicated&lt;/strong&gt;. Day passes by and my definition of love keeps getting shorter. Something so easy to experience, so difficult to express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re an interesting species. An interesting mix. You’re capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you’re not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we’ve found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.” — Carl Sagan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wonder when I listen to this quote in the song &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AoJwMImQZE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Doves by We Are All Astronauts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my college, I have never walked up to a complete stranger and ended up being friends. It is hard for most people to do so. No matter how much we understand the importance of interacting with new people, mostly in the early years of our lives, it is not an easy thing to do. In my freshmen year, I never knocked the doors of my neighbors or any of my wingmates to learn about them. It was a conscious decision. But I now realize, there wasn’t a random to-be-friend knock on my door either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many years and friendships later, I can now understand that between me and any of my friends, there is always one common “thread.” It can be the Literary Society (TLS), or the Open Source folks, or the ones from KOTA, or my wing-mates, post-rock music, department, being intoxicated together, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two unacquainted people to start a conversation, it is a bit difficult to talk directly about each other. It won’t even go well. But it becomes relatively simple if they talk about anything that they have in common. And then they always remember that thread connecting them for the next few meetups until they don’t need the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how many threads KGP creates in our lives, to give us friendships for lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Peeking over what people search on DC</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/post/peeking-over-dc-search/</link>

      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO BE A DC ADMIN TO GET THIS, NO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. Anyone can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Schnikes!!!! TELL ME HOW TO DO IT ON DC++!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lol, come to Linux already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I shall not be giving out a one-click solution to monitor DC searches intentionally even if it were possible. But if you are dedicated enough, you can figure things out by reading it. Also, I’m not the first person to know about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_%28protocol%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;What is DC?&lt;/a&gt; It’s a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. Computers connected with each other can share files among them, and if you are on LAN, you get them on a terrific speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GET TO THE POINT!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;theory&#34;&gt;Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say Mr X and I are connected to a DC hub. Let’s say it happens that both of us are online at the same time. Mr X searched for &lt;code&gt;New movies&lt;/code&gt; in their favorite DC client e.g. DC++, LinuxDC++, etc. Their client sends this request to the hub we both are connected, to fetch a search result. The hub then forwards the request to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who is connected to it and returns the index for Mr X to click and download any file from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO GIVE ME THE SCRIPT. OR DO YOU HAVE THE CODE OR A REPOSITORY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t really a script or any code. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;exploit&#34;&gt;Exploit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the theory, we can sit back, stay connected to the hub and receive a holy large amount of data like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who joined/left the hub when, their nick and their IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are people searching for and IP address associated with each query&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in KGP, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/IP_allocation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;trace back the IP addresses to even room numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technology&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal DC clients won’t allow us to see these requests. There is a client known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ncdc&lt;/a&gt; (distributed as a binary) which doesn’t really have a GUI, so you can run it on a terminal (Aah, the feels it gives!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ncdc to connect to the hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable logging to a file and set &lt;code&gt;log_debug&lt;/code&gt; to True&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This will generate a lot of data if you’re connected to a large hub and thus make sure you keep clearing the log file&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;tail -f /path/to/logfile&lt;/code&gt; to see the queries sent by DC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse the queries and tada!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protip: You can feed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kibana&lt;/a&gt; the data and visualize them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably will have to set some config in ncdc to change from Passive mode to Active mode or else, some hubs mights ban you. Google properly, read the ncdc documentation and you’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@icyflame&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Siddharth Kannan&lt;/a&gt; used tcpdump to capture the TCP/IP packets which contains the DC query strings as well. Check out the 107,000 search results he accumulated in a week over here stored as &lt;code&gt;all_packet_info.json&lt;/code&gt;. This is the code he used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo tcpdump -b -t src 10.109.xx.xx -w incoming-search-`date +%s`.pcap -c 1000;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-streaming&#34;&gt;Live Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard. But if you really want to live stream the searches and that to be accessible outside of the campus network, there is a hack. You can have a server hosted somewhere outside the network which is going to stream data to the public. Share the URL of this server to people you want to. Create an endpoint over here which can receive data through POST request. Now, use your laptop from inside the network to constantly send requests on to the server. Make sure to use authentication by headers to avoid exploitation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dc-audio/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; leftover &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dctrends&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; if you can find use of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have this, here’s something you need to remember: Don’t be dick. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Hacking! ✨&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brain, Mind and Consciousness — Essay</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/post/brain-mind-and-consciousness/</link>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layers of ‘I’ when perceiving anything which is external to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Montaigne, one of the first essay writers, for popularizing this literary genre. As the title suggests, I have had many musings upon the similarity and the differences of these three entities which can be thought as a subset of ‘&lt;em&gt;I’&lt;/em&gt; and which have very diffused boundaries among their definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: The following ideas are highly subjective. I would not advise the reader to consider them factual. Also, instead of focusing too much on the scientific details, the reader should try to read the hints to what I’m trying to communicate by using language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;let-s-define&#34;&gt;Let’s Define&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am) — René DescartesThe entity ‘I’ or ‘Me’ is a strange topic of discussion. While some people would oversimplify this to the human body, others might overcomplicate and make this is a subject of spiritual mysticism. I want to remain sane on this topic and probably write the words which can make sense in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the majority of ‘I’ is divided into three parts or layers, namely the Brain, the Mind and the Consciousness. The Brain is the outermost layer, the frontier of the Self. Take a scenario for example. You are reading this text. The first ‘You’ is your eyes, receiving colorful light rays from the screen. The ‘You’ then converts this information into electrical signals for further processing. This part is called Brain. It is an entirely physical entity, made of matter which interacts with the outer world through our senses, i.e., sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brain is very close to a computer program, and vice versa. It is programmed to execute in a definite manner. When given a set of inputs, it runs the required number and type of processes and is done with it. It encounters bugs in its lifetime which causes the dysfunctioning of some module. It also has a computing power and needs resources such as oxygen and food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brain then tries to pass this information to our Consciousness but in comes the Mind. The Mind is that child of ours, whom we love so much that we probably can never stop listening to. The Mind constitutes of our thoughts, our emotions associated with those thoughts, reactions and Ego. If you have disliked this essay so far, your brain has nothing to do with it; it just is feeding the information to your Mind, which is sitting only to judge the content. The Mind will then react and ask your Brain (followed by the senses) to either continue or stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*G7iss0cgkvwcZuBdvvjXmw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I’ in terms of processing an informationWe can look at the Mind as a semi-physical entity. On one side it shares boundaries with the physical bodies like sensations and hormones, while on the other hand, it has slight access to the metaphysical entities inside us which are hard to define as matter, i.e., Consciousness and Ego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*6IXNzi_k8lbhFVaLm-8WFg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of perceivable matter in each entityThe Consciousness is the purest form of ‘I,’ which does not think, which does not react, which does not speak with our mouth, which does not listen with our ears, which does not recognize anything as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. It is a thoughtless entity. It can interchangeably be understood as ‘the energy of life’. If you have ever been a psychonaut, this is the ‘vibration’ part of self, and it does communicate to other consciousness. If your consciousness is unaware of something which only your brain and mind knows (Take the statement ‘*We should love everyone*’ for example), it is entirely possible that you might react unexpectedly in extreme situations, contradictory to what you think you should never have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-chariot&#34;&gt;The Chariot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the scene from the epic Mahabharat? During the battle scene, the chariot with the most attention was of Arjun. Now there’s a great symbolism to be drawn from the setting. There is Arjun with all the weapons, perplexed with the myriad of thoughts about the battle, sitting on a chariot with Krishna, who is calm and patiently replying to all of the questions thrown by Arjun. Krishna is also the charioteer, holding the reins. There are horses driving the chariot, and finally, there’s the battleground, the vast ground where the chariot can roam around and interact with other chariots and other entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively if we are to compare this one picture with ‘I,’ the chariot is similar to a Body. Arjun is like the Mind having all of its thoughts, ego, and confusions. Krishna is the inner Consciousness. The reins connect the Mind with the horses, which are to be interpreted as the senses we use to interact with the external world, which here is the entire battleground of Kurukshetra. The ‘I’ functions when everything is at their place, resonating in perfect coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the questionnaire (popularly known as Bhagavad Gita), Krishna drives the chariot and is only capable of waking Arjun up and channeling all of his powers. I don’t know how reliable this symbolism should be held but loosely it’s very similar to the game of Mind and Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;change&#34;&gt;Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are these entities altered?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the Brain is straightforward. One can close their eyes, put on earphones with music and there, the state of their Brain is now different. But closing the eyes does not mean the person shall stop thinking about it. The change in Brain has little to no effects on the Mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the Mind is a tedious process. It requires expertise to govern thoughts from coming in and going out. It is a long process to gain control over one’s Ego. These methods can be classified under various Meditative techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the Consciousness makes you a Psychonaut. A Psychonaut is a person who experiences intentionally induced altered states of consciousness and claims to use the experience to investigate his or her Mind, and possibly address spiritual questions, through direct experience. A change in Consciousness will, by default, reflect on the Mind and the Brain as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about Enlightenment, they mean altered Consciousness and not a new Mind. All the humans feel love, sadness, hate, anger, etc., every single one of us and is, in fact, one of the traits which define us. A monk in the Himalayas is undoubtedly not deprived of Mind, but they probably know how to open up with the Consciousness directly and not let Mind be a middle-man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment doesn’t care how we reach there. — Thaddeus GolasThe consciousness can be altered with prolonged meditation (very subjective to the technique and the person). The use of naturally occurring mushrooms containing psilocybin, DMT, LSD and many other psychedelic and psychoactive substances can also challenge Consciousness to its very core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication&#34;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if there is any test to know whether some information which was thrown at us, has reached our consciousness or not. Merely hearing it ensures Brain level perception. Pondering over it as a thought provides that it is floating in our Mind. But how can we know if our Consciousness is aware of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one practice which can make sure the thought isn’t stuck in the Mind. The method is to “Avoid Overthinking.” Overthinking is terrible. It is a risky business. On the one hand, it opens up new insights to a thought, on the other side it leads to the loss of reality and makes it very hard for any information to escape from our Minds. Another good practice is to not letting our Ego come into the picture. We can do it by not allowing our subjective feelings and judgment interfere while we catch a piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that ‘I’ can be dissolved into these three entities can have very positive effects while communicating with others. If we can see that our words will be reflected by their layer of Ego, there is no way we can deliver our message to them despite speaking for any length of time, since it will never reach their Consciousness. We can then find out the correct choice of words to avoid their shiny surface of Mind which is eager to reflect anything that is thrown towards it such that it pierces through and reaches their Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times, we have the tendency to solve a problem with another person, just by speaking to them. Example can be a conflict of interest with our parents, friends or a significant other. But it’s wise to understand that the situation might have left the Mind of the other person very confused, and it’s best not to talk since our words will quickly bounce off them. It’s better to sit back, wait, till they work out with their Mind and are ready to communicate. Interesting to note that this is counter-intuitive to our Minds which quickly reacts by blabbering out whatever we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-not-my-thoughts&#34;&gt;I am not my Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is “watching the breath” one of the first and simplest meditation techniques? During Vipassana, it is suggested to start first by the practice of watching the whole breathing cycle and rather focus on the nostrils. This is not Vipassana, but it acts as an anchor to calm the Mind so that we would be able to do the actual practice. We can give an analogy of the mind to that of a chattering monkey. The Mind usually does not shut up and keeps feeding us with thoughts, ego, and their effects. We then tell the Mind, “O hey! Do you see this? Do you see me inhaling and exhaling? It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Watch!”. It’s like giving a crying baby, a toy to play with and making her come at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we start watching our thoughts, we begin to accept, and later appreciate the meaninglessness of them. Merely by watching them come and go, we build up a tolerance for a reaction, and it stops us from engaging from them in the future. We learn how futile are our thoughts, opinions, and judgments. Often at times, people are afraid of meaninglessness, which makes them value their thoughts very much. This makes them misinterpret that they are their thoughts, and thus, they build up a thick layer over their Consciousness, which is another meaningless and thoughtless entity. There is a possibility that life gets more beautiful if we stop yearning for everything to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ego&#34;&gt;Ego&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ego is a word which has been overstated and misunderstood a lot of times. Never is one’s true ego positive or negative, it’s the thoughts associated with it. A negative thought pattern can be removed while keeping the Ego intact. We just can’t let it happen very easily, since it’s so powerful. Ego is the ID of the Mind; it’s what makes us respond to someone calling our name. It might sound blissful to live after ‘Ego Death’, but that’s not how anyone can survive. Killing one’s ego is killing Self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ego death isn’t desirable, then what is? Here is a comment from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/43oysz/how_is_ego_death_beneficial/czjv2nn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;/r/Psychonaut&lt;/a&gt; which I find very relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t believe complete Ego death is possible, or even desirable. What I suggest is mastery of the Ego. Think of it like a wild animal to be tamed instead of destroyed. It is a part of you, an integral and important one, in fact, but for most people, it’s grown monstrous and completely out of control. Or put differently, it is in full control. And so we become passengers in these meat machines, with the Ego at the wheel. Dangerous stuff!
The Ego is only the Ego so long as it remains distinct and separate from the rest of you. The process we should undergo is what Carl Jung called individuation: the uniting of a fractured mind, of a psyche, compartmentalized and segregated into individual parts; the merging of conscious and unconscious, Self and Ego, reasoning mind and intuitive mind. The result is that we become indivisible, whole, balanced, and more importantly, in control.
How does this benefit you? Well, imagine two pilots wrestling for control of the ship. Good luck getting to your destination! Or better yet, good luck agreeing on a target. Before individuation, we’re torn and divided, conflicted and confused. We’re being driven, not doing the driving, you see? The Ego wants one thing, the Self another, and then it’s a battle for control. Or else the Ego is whispering sweet lies, and the Self is buying them wholesale so that the Self comes to believe that it and the Ego are one. This is a nice little tactic by the Ego, and one that can be observed in people on a daily basis. Defensiveness is an obvious indication of Ego identification. What are you defending? An opinion? A belief? A role? These things are not you, only things you do or things you cling to, but the Ego grows strong from false identification and so pokes and prods you into getting your back up whenever these are called into question.
How do you merge with the shadow? The first step is identifying it in yourself by distinguishing between the essential you — the Self, or pure consciousness — and the stuff that isn’t you. By watching your thoughts, words, and actions, seeking out incoherence and contradictions, defensiveness and sore spots, and then calling these into question. Be harsh with yourself. And whatever you do, don’t shy away from the ugly bits: that’s where the Ego likes to hide out.### Ignorance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t we hate it when we write or speak all the facts and support our argument while the person on the other side just &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; to ignore those and raises some of their own? It is happening every second on Facebook and Twitter comments section, and it’s eating out a lot of Brains. But why do people choose to be ignorant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment we add our entire Mind in the equation of &lt;em&gt;thought process&lt;/em&gt;, it by default, includes the sensations in our body, emotional reactions, opinions, and separately, the Brainly activities, i.e., Reading/Listening and Writing/Speaking. Now, the Brain has no trouble in receiving any argument, neither the Consciousness has; but it’s the Mind, and if the words are causing any unpleasant sensations, we tend to reject it. And that’s where we lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No sensation is either good or bad. However, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; arise. It’s natural for all of us. The key is not in ceasing it, but accepting it, accepting that impermanence is a real thing. The sensations have come, only to pass away. It has no real meaning, and we should not be trying to give it any value. We indulge in reactions too often and thus end up losing the direct communication with our Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;consciousness&#34;&gt;Consciousness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, we only know the tip of the iceberg known as Consciousness. I am very impressed by Yuval Noah Harari’s understanding of the consciousness and the scientific aspects of it, written in his book &lt;em&gt;Homo Deus&lt;/em&gt;. To me, understanding one’s consciousness is a very complicated subject since it’s very easy to overthink it. It is the subjective ability to experience. Anything can be an experience, merely sitting somewhere alone in lush green, or talking to a person, or watching the leaves fall from a tree, anything and everything can become an experience and our consciousness is responsible for the subjective aspects of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not capable of writing about it. I’m not capable of using terms like ‘Vibration’ and ‘Energy’ to describe it. But I secretly wish, for a scientific explanation in centuries when we’d be pondering over the consciousness of Artificial Intelligence. Even if I can see things as it is (it’s the literal meaning of &lt;em&gt;Vipassana&lt;/em&gt;), I wish things to be proven for a systematic understanding by the humanity. Wait, what is String Theory &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*0l-9QfuqEhDiBumKeTmGuQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After letting Facebook Inc. build a vast profile of me for 9 years, I deleted my facebook account. Privacy is not my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; concern, but I &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/the-discovery-of-pseudo-acquaintance-9f903601d916&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;personally reacted&lt;/a&gt; to how Facebook has affected &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16800842/facebook-2017-russia-scandal-news-feed-criticism-defectors&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the way we interact in our real life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downloaded a copy of my data from facebook -&amp;gt; settings
This contained all of my messages, photos, videos, and probably a lot more information which I can not consciously recall sharing with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created a dummy facebook account* and added it to the resourceful groups I might miss out important information from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*An account without any interaction i.e. No likes, No reactions neither love nor angry, no comments, no photos/videos, no “friends”. A profile to just receive information on email (sent by facebook).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Going extreme) Blocked Facebook servers on my computer that my computer can never communicate to domain names linked to Facebook servers. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists/tree/master/corporations/facebook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;social-concerns&#34;&gt;Social concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People started using Facebook as LinkedIn by adding Freinds and it blurred the lines of relationships between two individuals — &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/the-discovery-of-pseudo-acquaintance-9f903601d916&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real addiction to unreal things — &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3ev7GXzFTPg?t=3m10s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook (read &lt;em&gt;Social Media&lt;/em&gt;) promotes Ignorance by thoughtless comments, replies and reactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;privacy-concerns&#34;&gt;Privacy concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will suffice — &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/facebook.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://stallman.org/facebook.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The Discovery of pseudo-Acquaintance</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/post/pseudo-acquaintance/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/post/pseudo-acquaintance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the dawn of the 20th century. If we pick two homo sapiens on earth, we can classify their relationship as one of these three types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Acquaintance (Both of them are acquainted with each other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfamiliarity (No one knows about the existence of other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrity status (One of the two is famous)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the dawn of the 21st century. And every day in my college I meet few people who fall in none of the three types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day I see people on 2.2, whom I know by face and name, as well as they know me and my name. But we don’t stop to say, ‘Hi’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are my &lt;em&gt;pseudo-acquaintances&lt;/em&gt; whom I got to know from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the deal. Somewhere in the data centers of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of those people and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings which either they or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of “comment” as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that a person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spots them in public, that same person for the first time in months, there is no surge of emotions to go and talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know someone on Facebook, I “interact” with them, but I don’t speak with the same passion or eagerness to them in real life, using flesh and bones. For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger let them use that gif meme to convey more efficiently. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, raises merely questions about parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make, do not physically exist around them. I am surely, not saying one is better than others; there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion of friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control after some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; This article above was an email to a few close friends, right after I realized my first pseudo-acquaintance. I am thankful to their responses, they made me rethink every bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been quite long since I joined Facebook.com and I have spent a lot of time with the product. I have met and stayed connected with a lot of people using this platform, and therefore, I am probably thankful for it. However, here is my current setup, as of now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t use the product ‘news feed’. I use a version of News Feed Eradicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran a custom Javascript script to unfollow all of my Facebook friends and then turned on the notifications for few, as I deemed necessary in my real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the phone, I do not have the Facebook app and I use messenger with the setting where I do not receive any notification (interrupts) but I would instead open the app to see if there any new messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing that I want to say is that there are mostly no good and no wrong sides. As a human, we always have to use our discretion and find something in between. Hence I can not blindly delete Facebook to solve this problem, I’ll have to see the way to use it for my productivity, as long as it doesn’t consume a lot of my time to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Update, &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/deletefacebook-10f365c5d36e&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I deleted my Facebook account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design of Public Posts: Twitter vs Facebook</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/post/twitter-vs-facebook/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/post/twitter-vs-facebook/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What design tells you about the company’s values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Facebook and Twitter allow posts to be publicly accessible by people who have not joined the platform. It is good to note that the default setting of Facebook is to be private with posts and Twitter to be open to the web. While managing the Facebook and Twitter account of an organization I am involved in, I noticed a serious design pattern involved in displaying the public posts and their stark differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;case-1-stages-of-interacting-with-twitter&#34;&gt;Case 1: Stages of interacting with Twitter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you open a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp/status/954776125573554176&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;public tweet&lt;/a&gt; in incognito mode, or while being logged out, you’ll land on something like this —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*jYcPCOlsEVbI7WL7oEhE9A.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Public post on Twitter (viewed while logged out)**Stage 1 **of interaction consists of the &lt;em&gt;content of the tweet&lt;/em&gt; with the highest visibility, followed by who created the tweet, then more details about the tweet. At this point of time, there is no available “Sign Up” button to be clicked. You can now easily close the tab since most of the times, your purpose would be the information contained in the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you feel engaged and you click on the close button on the top right corner, you’ll land on the profile page of the account which created the tweet, which I call the &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*fgnX8sn_C3B7RBuzTF614g.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 of a public tweet (while being logged out)You can see that the majority percentage of the web page is covered with the profile information. On the sidebar and header, there are interactive elements which lead you to sign up on the platform. And you would do, if you seem impressed. Let’s have a look at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2: Stages of interacting with a public post on Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you open a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/photos/a.551030724973932.1073741826.524856034258068/1588200897923571/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;public post&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, you land on something like this —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*-sIjEoUp6WckYnrziAf_KQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to notice that much more than half of the area is covered with &lt;strong&gt;ways to either join or log in to Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;. And the Stage 1 has *&lt;strong&gt;zero* information about the post&lt;/strong&gt; (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny ***Not Now ***text below the big Green &lt;em&gt;Create New Account&lt;/em&gt;. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of *Not Now *and &lt;em&gt;Forgotten Account?&lt;/em&gt; is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it’s intentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s click on &lt;em&gt;Not Now&lt;/em&gt;, and move the &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2&lt;/strong&gt; of the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 of the view, after clicking Not Now in Stage 1On this webpage, the area covered with the information about the post is still comparable or maybe less than the &lt;em&gt;engageble area of log in and sign up&lt;/em&gt;. It’s funny to note that there are &lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt; interactive buttons on this single web page to Join Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Facebook’s main focus is on targeting as many people as they can, while Twitter’s main focus does not &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; so. Even if both the products want users, Facebook is &lt;strong&gt;desperately user-hungry&lt;/strong&gt; in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Content is not respected on Facebook while Twitter values the content over anything else. Eventually content dies out on Facebook while people keep retweeting and referring 5 year old tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reading. This post is up for suggestions and discussions!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quest for Universal action — Essay</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/post/quest-for-universal-action/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/post/quest-for-universal-action/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may listen to this while reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;display: flex; justify-content: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/-fFbeSykaJk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few months ago, a significant percentage of my peers were involved in the process of getting a job or an internship, including me. Some got the &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt; while some are still trying. But to my astonishment, I found that the degree of comfort in each one of them was not as expected. What I mean by that is, not everyone who got this success was happy, and not everyone who failed was sad, although the majority was skewed on the side of the former case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I broadened my perspective and timeframe, I found that getting a job which pays in money, is not something which can give satisfaction to every human being. We cannot universally advise this to everyone. If you think so, then please understand the gravity of human population on this planet, and my concern was about satisfaction which is difficult to define, since a large part of it loses touch with materialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I aligned my line of thought with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;loving the work we do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If a farmer spends the day on their field, and they enjoy it, then it’s good, isn’t it? How about the software engineer who thinks their technology can help people or maybe due to some other reason, they find love in the code, they write? I found that it was closer to being a ubiquitous activity which can keep people happy, or at least a large number of humans. But then, I saw people who do not have any job at first place. By &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;, I mean an activity which benefits people and provides something (&lt;em&gt;e.g. salary&lt;/em&gt;) in return for the individual. But there are wanderers, &lt;em&gt;fakirs&lt;/em&gt;, hitchhikers and many types of &lt;em&gt;unemployed&lt;/em&gt; people. So, are they different from &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt;? These people challenged the universality of this line of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It further gave me an idea that instead of (or along with) loving the work, we also need to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;enjoy with the peers who surround us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. So, a lot of human beings are embraced by their parents, friends and/or children. It does not happen always, but we can still find some of these in different bandwidths of our life. It reminded me of the letter by Richard Feynman, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lettersofnote.com/2015/10/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Do not remain nameless to yourself&lt;/a&gt;. So yeah, Living in love can be a universal thing to do. And it allowed me to picture this massive population of ours on the planet earth. But then, I found exceptions. I thought of Chris McCandless (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_%28film%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and how he did not find love in his family but Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*nVDd-ZNwdd9EGJ3iLxpEzg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;A scene from the movie Into the WildI was back to square one. Do we need another human being to live this life, happily? People can not always surround us. And further, outside of seven billion humans, there are other lives as well. What about dogs, or the trees, plants, and flowers which are alive? Or a lost animal somewhere in the jungle. Do they have to have a peer to share the love or their &lt;em&gt;pursuit of happiness&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem set got bigger, and I appreciated &lt;em&gt;how difficult it must be for a democracy to form its constitution&lt;/em&gt; or King Hammurabi to write his &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, I felt a little exhausted in finding the answer to my question (it had been several months by now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a few days ago, as I was practicing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassana-meditation_in_the_modern_Vipassana_movement&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vipassana Meditation&lt;/a&gt;, I had an epiphany about the question. I realized how much did I miss to observe about my own physical body even when there was so much going on already. I never noticed my breath on its whole (trust me, when I say, I still have not). The moment we start to breathe in, and it goes on for a full length, and then it stops. A moment of no activity, and then we breathe out. And the cycle repeats. Breathing is just one of the many involuntary signs of life, and yet it goes on unnoticed. It made me regard the totality around me, even more. To mention a few, the breeze which blows past me when I stroll on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2.2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt;, the distant sound I listen to while typing this text, the leaves which fall off from the trees when I sit with a cup of &lt;em&gt;chai&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Bhaski%27s/@22.3161081,87.2988514,21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a1d43feddbb1c35:0xeff718f07e02348!8m2!3d22.3159891!4d87.2987071&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bhaski’s&lt;/a&gt;, and other many signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, for the question of &lt;em&gt;“What is something which should be the universal action of everyone?”&lt;/em&gt;, I can put it in words as “&lt;em&gt;To witness”&lt;/em&gt;. We necessarily do not have to think, question, or react to the activities around us or &lt;em&gt;even inside us&lt;/em&gt;, but to just witness the presence of life. In Sanskrit, we call this state of no-mind as निर्विचार. I felt that generally, we are ignorant of ourselves and we miss to observe a lot. With this awareness and focus, the decisions we make are quite apparent, and we can then work on optimizing our limited time on this planet to do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought, Python could not be more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-hello-world&#34;&gt;1. Hello World&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import __hello__
Hello World!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-the-classic&#34;&gt;2. The classic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import this

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren&#39;t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&#39;re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it&#39;s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let&#39;s do more of those!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-the-missing-line-from-the-classic&#34;&gt;3. The missing line from the classic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zen of Python was introduced in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PEP 20&lt;/a&gt;. It is supposed to be 20 aphorisms, but only 19 of which have been written down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-a-simple-life-lesson&#34;&gt;4. A simple life lesson&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import this
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; love = this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this is love
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; love is True
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; love is False
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; love is not True or False
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; love is not True or False; love is love  # FML
True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-comics-yeah&#34;&gt;5. Comics, yeah.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import antigravity
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-it-s-not-a-choice-it-defines-who-we-are&#34;&gt;6. It&amp;rsquo;s not a choice, it defines who we are&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from __future__ import braces
  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Python has nothing to do with the type of Snake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-the-confuscation&#34;&gt;8. The confuscation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the &lt;code&gt;this.py&lt;/code&gt; module looks, which prints the Zen of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;s = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Gur Mra bs Clguba, ol Gvz Crgref

d = {}
for c in (65, 97):
    for i in range(26):
        d[chr(i+c)] = chr((i+13) % 26 + c)

print(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;.join([d.get(c, c) for c in s]))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for the Zen violates itself. It&amp;rsquo;s not beautiful but ugly, not explicit but implicit.
This would probably be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; module to go against the spirit of what it says itself.
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-c-c-anyone&#34;&gt;9. C/C++ anyone?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Zen again,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-naming-identifiers-can-be-unspeakably-cool&#34;&gt;10. Naming identifiers can be unspeakably cool&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought that working in Python couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; any more fun,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from math import pi
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; π = pi
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; area = π * r**2

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; résumé = &#39;knows Python&#39;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &#39;Python&#39; in résumé
True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;11-picking-a-place-for-meetup&#34;&gt;11. Picking a place for meetup?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from antigravity import geohash
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; # Your location, a date and that date&#39;s (or most recent) DJIA opening.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; geohash(37.421542, -122.085589, b&#39;2005-05-26-10458.68&#39;)
37.857713 -122.544543
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can generate a GPS coordinate in a region which is 1 longitude long and 1
latitude wide based on your location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-the-flufl-friendly-language-uncle-for-life-from-pep-401-bdfl-retirement-https-www-python-org-dev-peps-pep-0401&#34;&gt;12. The FLUFL - Friendly Language Uncle For Life from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PEP 401 &amp;ndash; BDFL Retirement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from __future__ import barry_as_FLUFL
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1 &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 2

    1 != 2
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognized that the != inequality operator in Python 3.0 was a horrible, finger pain inducing mistake, the FLUFL reinstates the &amp;lt;&amp;gt; diamond operator as the sole spelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;13-inpynite&#34;&gt;13. InPynite?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-py&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; infinity = float(&#39;infinity&#39;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hash(infinity)
314159
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hash(float(&#39;-inf&#39;))

&lt;p&gt;A hash is a fixed sized integer that identifies a particular value. On a closer look, the hash of infinity is 10^5 x pi. Interestingly, hash(float(&amp;lsquo;-inf&amp;rsquo;)) yields -10^5 x pi in python3, whereeas -271828 i.e - 10^5 x e in python2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Easiest hello world program in a language without calling any function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each and every line is the philosophy of Python&amp;rsquo;s design and is a supreme holy guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe just to show that there always should be a new line at the end of a file!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not an easter egg, a joke in the interpreter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It opens this &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/353&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; which demonstrates how easy it is to do stuff with modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is to instantly close down any conversation about introducing curly braces to Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guido van Rossum is a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Monty Python&amp;rsquo;s Flying Circus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a substitution cipher called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ROT13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many languages there are two ways to do the same thing &lt;code&gt;--no&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;no--&lt;/code&gt;. The message has a hidden example in itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for unicode character set for naming identifiers was added in Python3. Though, it is not explicitly preferred while writing code, it adds flavour to working with scientific formulas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/antigravity.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/426/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; referenced, and maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why this is also in the &lt;code&gt;antigravity&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PEP 401&lt;/a&gt; is an April Fools&amp;rsquo; Joke - The PEP&amp;rsquo;s number is 401, i.e. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; or April 1st (April Fools&amp;rsquo; Day). The PEP states that Guido van Rossum is stepping down. The new title given to him would be pronounced &amp;ldquo;BDEVIL&amp;rdquo; (Benevolent Dictator Emeritus Vacationing Indefinitely from the Language) and Guido&amp;rsquo;s successor will be Barry Warsaw, or as he is affectionately known, Uncle Barry. Uncle Barry&amp;rsquo;s official title is &amp;ldquo;FLUFL&amp;rdquo; (Friendly Language Uncle For Life). There are in-jokes about the Parrot virtual machine and the &amp;ldquo;non-existent&amp;rdquo; Python Secret Underground (possibly a throw-back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Is_No_Cabal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;TINC&amp;rdquo; on USENET&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

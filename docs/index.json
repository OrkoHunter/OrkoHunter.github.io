How do you distinguish genuine love for someone from infatuation? was the question.\nAnd I want to quote what I read and later express some of my thoughts on the subject. Here is the original comment.\n This is a good question.\n\u0026hellip; It’s really easy to confuse it with genuine love. But for me anyway, infatuation is a lot more like a drug.\nIt’s a feeling that consumes you with temporary euphoric highs, and deep, dark lows. It’s almost like a panicked state of obsession. It fills your brain so all you can think about is that person. You start to care less about what really matters in your own life\u0026hellip;your goals, your friends, your work. All that matters when you’re infatuated, is them. And you feel a strong, leeching desire to mold yourself into the person you think they’d want you to be.\nWhen you’re infatuated with someone, when that person gets closer to you in any way, you feel a rush. Like you’re on cloud 9. Like you just popped a bunch of really good ecstasy. And it feels amazing in the moment. But then when you sense them distancing from you in any way\u0026hellip;an ignored text. A rescheduled date. Flirting with another person. Going out on the town without you. Whatever. It feels like the world is crumbling\u0026hellip;like you’re going through a withdrawal. You panic and fear you’re going to lose them. There’s a constant push/pull. In those moments of panic all you care about is pulling them back to you. Those up and downs can be maddening over time.\nAt its core, I think infatuation is latching onto the idealized picture your brain paints of someone. \u0026hellip; You feel in love with them even though you barely know what’s it like to really be with them. \u0026hellip; You start thinking crazy thoughts like “this person is perfect”\u0026hellip;”this person is the solution to all of my problems, if I can just keep them I’ll be fulfilled”\u0026hellip;”if I can’t have this person I’ll never be genuinely happy”. You think you’re madly in love. But it’s all shallow. Once that person actually starts getting closer to you\u0026hellip;the infatuation can wear off pretty quickly\u0026hellip;and you can be left feeling confused and deflated. Like a spent firework.\nI think most “love at first sight”, and honeymoon periods is really just infatuation. It can turn into love, but it’s not really. And sometimes if you’re not careful, it can blind you and drag you down into some really dark places.\nLove on the other hand, is a lot more comfortable. It’s less erratic. It grows slowly over time and stays pretty constant. Its the general feeling of caring and warmth towards someone. You can hate someone in a current moment, but still love them overall. You can find someone to be unattractive, or incompatible\u0026hellip;and still love them deep down. You can have a fight with the person you love, and not fear you’re going to lose them\u0026hellip;you just want to revolve it.\nIt’s not like a drug\u0026hellip;it doesn’t have the highs and lows of infatuation. Its gotta be cultivated and nurtured. You don’t lose yourself in it, or have the drive to turn into the person they want you to be\u0026hellip;love helps you find yourself, and drives you to become the person you want to be. Love for a partner isn’t too different than the love you feel for a blood relative. It can be subtle and mellow\u0026hellip;sometimes barely recognizable\u0026hellip;but it’s always there. You’re connected to them at a deep primal level.\n This left me thinking for some time. Some of my thoughts:\nWe have little control over our Infatuation, but Love is a practice. It is comforting to know that love is not a fixed biological property which is set since birth. It is so much about our choices. We can learn to love and become one with it. We can teach people to practice love. Infact, there exists a very profoud meditation technique called \u0026ldquo;Loving-Kindness\u0026rdquo;.\nPeople can sometimes fall in love with their infatuation but never the person. This is so interesting to think about! This can give someone a feeling of being in love. But as the infatuation fades, the love fades as well.\nInfatuation is not bad at all. It\u0026rsquo;s as if, infatuation is our survival mechanism. But love goes beyond just surviving. It is spiritual.\nLove is not an emotion. Happiness and Sadness come in phases. They are emotions. But love is always present, in us. Our mind may get distracted sometimes. (This is whole another perception, which I felt in one experience.)\nLove is very fundamental and not complicated. Day passes by and my definition of love keeps getting shorter. Something so easy to experience, so difficult to express.\n","date":1547078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547078400,"objectID":"471cf3eac2d564164c3e10ec3f38b0b1","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/love-and-infatuation/","publishdate":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/love-and-infatuation/","section":"post","summary":"After a long time, I read something so meaningful on reddit.

It is hard for most people to do so. No matter how much we understand the importance of interacting with new people, mostly in the early years of our lives, it is not an easy thing to do. In my freshmen year, I never knocked the doors of my neighbors or any of my wingmates to learn about them. It was a conscious decision. But I now realize, there wasn’t a random to-be-friend knock on my door either.\nSo many years and friendships later, I can now understand that between me and any of my friends, there is always one common “thread.” It can be the Literary Society (TLS), or the Open Source folks, or the ones from KOTA, or my wing-mates, post-rock music, department, being intoxicated together, etc.\nFor two unacquainted people to start a conversation, it is a bit difficult to talk directly about each other. It won’t even go well. But it becomes relatively simple if they talk about anything that they have in common. And then they always remember that thread connecting them for the next few meetups until they don’t need the reason.\nIt’s amazing how many threads KGP creates in our lives, to give us friendships for lifetime.\n","date":1539475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539475200,"objectID":"0b40d73196801d8fcef914eea9b7a6b6","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/threads/","publishdate":"2018-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/threads/","section":"post","summary":"“You’re an interesting species.

Anyone can do it.\n Holy Schnikes!!!! TELL ME HOW TO DO IT ON DC++!!\n Lol, come to Linux already!\nNote: I shall not be giving out a one-click solution to monitor DC searches intentionally even if it were possible. But if you are dedicated enough, you can figure things out by reading it. Also, I’m not the first person to know about this.\n What is DC? It’s a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. Computers connected with each other can share files among them, and if you are on LAN, you get them on a terrific speed.\nGET TO THE POINT!!\n Alright, alright.\nTheory Let’s say Mr X and I are connected to a DC hub. Let’s say it happens that both of us are online at the same time. Mr X searched for New movies in their favorite DC client e.g. DC++, LinuxDC++, etc. Their client sends this request to the hub we both are connected, to fetch a search result. The hub then forwards the request to everyone who is connected to it and returns the index for Mr X to click and download any file from anyone.\n SO GIVE ME THE SCRIPT. OR DO YOU HAVE THE CODE OR A REPOSITORY?\n There isn’t really a script or any code. :/\nExploit Because of the theory, we can sit back, stay connected to the hub and receive a holy large amount of data like\n Who joined/left the hub when, their nick and their IP address What are people searching for and IP address associated with each query  If you are in KGP, you can trace back the IP addresses to even room numbers.\nTechnology Normal DC clients won’t allow us to see these requests. There is a client known as ncdc (distributed as a binary) which doesn’t really have a GUI, so you can run it on a terminal (Aah, the feels it gives!)\n Use ncdc to connect to the hub Enable logging to a file and set log_debug to True Note: This will generate a lot of data if you’re connected to a large hub and thus make sure you keep clearing the log file Use tail -f /path/to/logfile to see the queries sent by DC Parse the queries and tada! Protip: You can feed Kibana the data and visualize them.  You probably will have to set some config in ncdc to change from Passive mode to Active mode or else, some hubs mights ban you. Google properly, read the ncdc documentation and you’ll be fine.\nEDIT: Siddharth Kannan used tcpdump to capture the TCP/IP packets which contains the DC query strings as well. Check out the 107,000 search results he accumulated in a week over here stored as all_packet_info.json. This is the code he used\nsudo tcpdump -b -t src 10.109.xx.xx -w incoming-search-`date +%s`.pcap -c 1000;  Live Streaming It’s hard.

As the title suggests, I have had many musings upon the similarity and the differences of these three entities which can be thought as a subset of ‘I’ and which have very diffused boundaries among their definitions.\nDisclaimer: The following ideas are highly subjective. I would not advise the reader to consider them factual. Also, instead of focusing too much on the scientific details, the reader should try to read the hints to what I’m trying to communicate by using language.\nLet’s Define  Cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am) — René DescartesThe entity ‘I’ or ‘Me’ is a strange topic of discussion. While some people would oversimplify this to the human body, others might overcomplicate and make this is a subject of spiritual mysticism. I want to remain sane on this topic and probably write the words which can make sense in daily life.\n For me, the majority of ‘I’ is divided into three parts or layers, namely the Brain, the Mind and the Consciousness. The Brain is the outermost layer, the frontier of the Self. Take a scenario for example. You are reading this text. The first ‘You’ is your eyes, receiving colorful light rays from the screen. The ‘You’ then converts this information into electrical signals for further processing. This part is called Brain. It is an entirely physical entity, made of matter which interacts with the outer world through our senses, i.e., sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.\nThe Brain is very close to a computer program, and vice versa. It is programmed to execute in a definite manner. When given a set of inputs, it runs the required number and type of processes and is done with it. It encounters bugs in its lifetime which causes the dysfunctioning of some module. It also has a computing power and needs resources such as oxygen and food.\nThe Brain then tries to pass this information to our Consciousness but in comes the Mind. The Mind is that child of ours, whom we love so much that we probably can never stop listening to. The Mind constitutes of our thoughts, our emotions associated with those thoughts, reactions and Ego. If you have disliked this essay so far, your brain has nothing to do with it; it just is feeding the information to your Mind, which is sitting only to judge the content. The Mind will then react and ask your Brain (followed by the senses) to either continue or stop reading.\n‘I’ in terms of processing an informationWe can look at the Mind as a semi-physical entity. On one side it shares boundaries with the physical bodies like sensations and hormones, while on the other hand, it has slight access to the metaphysical entities inside us which are hard to define as matter, i.e., Consciousness and Ego.\nThe amount of perceivable matter in each entityThe Consciousness is the purest form of ‘I,’ which does not think, which does not react, which does not speak with our mouth, which does not listen with our ears, which does not recognize anything as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. It is a thoughtless entity. It can interchangeably be understood as ‘the energy of life’. If you have ever been a psychonaut, this is the ‘vibration’ part of self, and it does communicate to other consciousness. If your consciousness is unaware of something which only your brain and mind knows (Take the statement ‘*We should love everyone*’ for example), it is entirely possible that you might react unexpectedly in extreme situations, contradictory to what you think you should never have done.\nThe Chariot Do you remember the scene from the epic Mahabharat? During the battle scene, the chariot with the most attention was of Arjun. Now there’s a great symbolism to be drawn from the setting. There is Arjun with all the weapons, perplexed with the myriad of thoughts about the battle, sitting on a chariot with Krishna, who is calm and patiently replying to all of the questions thrown by Arjun. Krishna is also the charioteer, holding the reins. There are horses driving the chariot, and finally, there’s the battleground, the vast ground where the chariot can roam around and interact with other chariots and other entities.\nCollectively if we are to compare this one picture with ‘I,’ the chariot is similar to a Body. Arjun is like the Mind having all of its thoughts, ego, and confusions. Krishna is the inner Consciousness. The reins connect the Mind with the horses, which are to be interpreted as the senses we use to interact with the external world, which here is the entire battleground of Kurukshetra. The ‘I’ functions when everything is at their place, resonating in perfect coordination.\nAfter all the questionnaire (popularly known as Bhagavad Gita), Krishna drives the chariot and is only capable of waking Arjun up and channeling all of his powers. I don’t know how reliable this symbolism should be held but loosely it’s very similar to the game of Mind and Consciousness.\nChange How are these entities altered?\nChanging the Brain is straightforward. One can close their eyes, put on earphones with music and there, the state of their Brain is now different. But closing the eyes does not mean the person shall stop thinking about it. The change in Brain has little to no effects on the Mind.\nChanging the Mind is a tedious process. It requires expertise to govern thoughts from coming in and going out. It is a long process to gain control over one’s Ego. These methods can be classified under various Meditative techniques.\nChanging the Consciousness makes you a Psychonaut. A Psychonaut is a person who experiences intentionally induced altered states of consciousness and claims to use the experience to investigate his or her Mind, and possibly address spiritual questions, through direct experience. A change in Consciousness will, by default, reflect on the Mind and the Brain as well.\nWhen people talk about Enlightenment, they mean altered Consciousness and not a new Mind. All the humans feel love, sadness, hate, anger, etc., every single one of us and is, in fact, one of the traits which define us. A monk in the Himalayas is undoubtedly not deprived of Mind, but they probably know how to open up with the Consciousness directly and not let Mind be a middle-man.\n Enlightenment doesn’t care how we reach there. — Thaddeus GolasThe consciousness can be altered with prolonged meditation (very subjective to the technique and the person). The use of naturally occurring mushrooms containing psilocybin, DMT, LSD and many other psychedelic and psychoactive substances can also challenge Consciousness to its very core.\n Communication I’m not sure if there is any test to know whether some information which was thrown at us, has reached our consciousness or not. Merely hearing it ensures Brain level perception. Pondering over it as a thought provides that it is floating in our Mind. But how can we know if our Consciousness is aware of it?\nThere is one practice which can make sure the thought isn’t stuck in the Mind. The method is to “Avoid Overthinking.” Overthinking is terrible. It is a risky business. On the one hand, it opens up new insights to a thought, on the other side it leads to the loss of reality and makes it very hard for any information to escape from our Minds. Another good practice is to not letting our Ego come into the picture. We can do it by not allowing our subjective feelings and judgment interfere while we catch a piece of information.\nKnowing that ‘I’ can be dissolved into these three entities can have very positive effects while communicating with others. If we can see that our words will be reflected by their layer of Ego, there is no way we can deliver our message to them despite speaking for any length of time, since it will never reach their Consciousness. We can then find out the correct choice of words to avoid their shiny surface of Mind which is eager to reflect anything that is thrown towards it such that it pierces through and reaches their Consciousness.\nMany times, we have the tendency to solve a problem with another person, just by speaking to them. Example can be a conflict of interest with our parents, friends or a significant other. But it’s wise to understand that the situation might have left the Mind of the other person very confused, and it’s best not to talk since our words will quickly bounce off them. It’s better to sit back, wait, till they work out with their Mind and are ready to communicate. Interesting to note that this is counter-intuitive to our Minds which quickly reacts by blabbering out whatever we can.\nI am not my Thoughts Why is “watching the breath” one of the first and simplest meditation techniques? During Vipassana, it is suggested to start first by the practice of watching the whole breathing cycle and rather focus on the nostrils. This is not Vipassana, but it acts as an anchor to calm the Mind so that we would be able to do the actual practice. We can give an analogy of the mind to that of a chattering monkey. The Mind usually does not shut up and keeps feeding us with thoughts, ego, and their effects. We then tell the Mind, “O hey! Do you see this? Do you see me inhaling and exhaling? It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Watch!”. It’s like giving a crying baby, a toy to play with and making her come at ease.\nOnce we start watching our thoughts, we begin to accept, and later appreciate the meaninglessness of them. Merely by watching them come and go, we build up a tolerance for a reaction, and it stops us from engaging from them in the future. We learn how futile are our thoughts, opinions, and judgments. Often at times, people are afraid of meaninglessness, which makes them value their thoughts very much. This makes them misinterpret that they are their thoughts, and thus, they build up a thick layer over their Consciousness, which is another meaningless and thoughtless entity. There is a possibility that life gets more beautiful if we stop yearning for everything to be meaningful.\nEgo Ego is a word which has been overstated and misunderstood a lot of times. Never is one’s true ego positive or negative, it’s the thoughts associated with it. A negative thought pattern can be removed while keeping the Ego intact. We just can’t let it happen very easily, since it’s so powerful. Ego is the ID of the Mind; it’s what makes us respond to someone calling our name. It might sound blissful to live after ‘Ego Death’, but that’s not how anyone can survive. Killing one’s ego is killing Self.\nIf ego death isn’t desirable, then what is? Here is a comment from /r/Psychonaut which I find very relevant.\n Personally, I don’t believe complete Ego death is possible, or even desirable. What I suggest is mastery of the Ego. Think of it like a wild animal to be tamed instead of destroyed. It is a part of you, an integral and important one, in fact, but for most people, it’s grown monstrous and completely out of control. Or put differently, it is in full control. And so we become passengers in these meat machines, with the Ego at the wheel. Dangerous stuff! The Ego is only the Ego so long as it remains distinct and separate from the rest of you. The process we should undergo is what Carl Jung called individuation: the uniting of a fractured mind, of a psyche, compartmentalized and segregated into individual parts; the merging of conscious and unconscious, Self and Ego, reasoning mind and intuitive mind. The result is that we become indivisible, whole, balanced, and more importantly, in control. How does this benefit you? Well, imagine two pilots wrestling for control of the ship. Good luck getting to your destination! Or better yet, good luck agreeing on a target. Before individuation, we’re torn and divided, conflicted and confused. We’re being driven, not doing the driving, you see? The Ego wants one thing, the Self another, and then it’s a battle for control. Or else the Ego is whispering sweet lies, and the Self is buying them wholesale so that the Self comes to believe that it and the Ego are one. This is a nice little tactic by the Ego, and one that can be observed in people on a daily basis. Defensiveness is an obvious indication of Ego identification. What are you defending? An opinion? A belief? A role? These things are not you, only things you do or things you cling to, but the Ego grows strong from false identification and so pokes and prods you into getting your back up whenever these are called into question. How do you merge with the shadow? The first step is identifying it in yourself by distinguishing between the essential you — the Self, or pure consciousness — and the stuff that isn’t you. By watching your thoughts, words, and actions, seeking out incoherence and contradictions, defensiveness and sore spots, and then calling these into question. Be harsh with yourself. And whatever you do, don’t shy away from the ugly bits: that’s where the Ego likes to hide out.### Ignorance\n Don’t we hate it when we write or speak all the facts and support our argument while the person on the other side just chooses to ignore those and raises some of their own? It is happening every second on Facebook and Twitter comments section, and it’s eating out a lot of Brains. But why do people choose to be ignorant?\nThe moment we add our entire Mind in the equation of thought process, it by default, includes the sensations in our body, emotional reactions, opinions, and separately, the Brainly activities, i.e., Reading/Listening and Writing/Speaking. Now, the Brain has no trouble in receiving any argument, neither the Consciousness has; but it’s the Mind, and if the words are causing any unpleasant sensations, we tend to reject it. And that’s where we lose.\nNo sensation is either good or bad. However, it will arise. It’s natural for all of us. The key is not in ceasing it, but accepting it, accepting that impermanence is a real thing. The sensations have come, only to pass away. It has no real meaning, and we should not be trying to give it any value. We indulge in reactions too often and thus end up losing the direct communication with our Consciousness.\nConsciousness To me, we only know the tip of the iceberg known as Consciousness. I am very impressed by Yuval Noah Harari’s understanding of the consciousness and the scientific aspects of it, written in his book Homo Deus. To me, understanding one’s consciousness is a very complicated subject since it’s very easy to overthink it. It is the subjective ability to experience. Anything can be an experience, merely sitting somewhere alone in lush green, or talking to a person, or watching the leaves fall from a tree, anything and everything can become an experience and our consciousness is responsible for the subjective aspects of it.\nI’m not capable of writing about it. I’m not capable of using terms like ‘Vibration’ and ‘Energy’ to describe it. But I secretly wish, for a scientific explanation in centuries when we’d be pondering over the consciousness of Artificial Intelligence. Even if I can see things as it is (it’s the literal meaning of Vipassana), I wish things to be proven for a systematic understanding by the humanity. Wait, what is String Theory again?\n","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"b35d3bae6fa93428d700e50d4a6b5a55","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/brain-mind-and-consciousness/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/brain-mind-and-consciousness/","section":"post","summary":"Layers of ‘I’ when perceiving anything which is external to it\n Thanks to Montaigne, one of the first essay writers, for popularizing this literary genre.

But we don’t stop to say, ‘Hi’\n These are my pseudo-acquaintances whom I got to know from Facebook.\nHere is the deal. Somewhere in the data centers of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of those people and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings which either they or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of “comment” as well.

But when the same mind physically spots them in public, that same person for the first time in months, there is no surge of emotions to go and talk to them.\nI know someone on Facebook, I “interact” with them, but I don’t speak with the same passion or eagerness to them in real life, using flesh and bones. For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger let them use that gif meme to convey more efficiently. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?\nAnd the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, raises merely questions about parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make, do not physically exist around them. I am surely, not saying one is better than others; there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion of friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control after some time.\n\n\u0026gt; This article above was an email to a few close friends, right after I realized my first pseudo-acquaintance.

I have met and stayed connected with a lot of people using this platform, and therefore, I am probably thankful for it. However, here is my current setup, as of now:\n I don’t use the product ‘news feed’. I use a version of News Feed Eradicator. I ran a custom Javascript script to unfollow all of my Facebook friends and then turned on the notifications for few, as I deemed necessary in my real life. On the phone, I do not have the Facebook app and I use messenger with the setting where I do not receive any notification (interrupts) but I would instead open the app to see if there any new messages.  The last thing that I want to say is that there are mostly no good and no wrong sides. As a human, we always have to use our discretion and find something in between.

On the sidebar and header, there are interactive elements which lead you to sign up on the platform. And you would do, if you seem impressed. Let’s have a look at Facebook.\nCase 2: Stages of interacting with a public post on Facebook\nIf you open a public post on Facebook, you land on something like this —\nIt’s interesting to notice that much more than half of the area is covered with ways to either join or log in to Facebook. And the Stage 1 has *zero* information about the post (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny ***Not Now ***text below the big Green Create New Account. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of *Not Now *and Forgotten Account? is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it’s intentional.\nLet’s click on Not Now, and move the Stage 2 of the view.\nStage 2 of the view, after clicking Not Now in Stage 1On this webpage, the area covered with the information about the post is still comparable or maybe less than the engageble area of log in and sign up. It’s funny to note that there are five interactive buttons on this single web page to Join Facebook.\nConclusions: — Facebook’s main focus is on targeting as many people as they can, while Twitter’s main focus does not appear so. Even if both the products want users, Facebook is desperately user-hungry in public.\n— Content is not respected on Facebook while Twitter values the content over anything else.

Some got the success while some are still trying. But to my astonishment, I found that the degree of comfort in each one of them was not as expected. What I mean by that is, not everyone who got this success was happy, and not everyone who failed was sad, although the majority was skewed on the side of the former case.\nAs I broadened my perspective and timeframe, I found that getting a job which pays in money, is not something which can give satisfaction to every human being. We cannot universally advise this to everyone. If you think so, then please understand the gravity of human population on this planet, and my concern was about satisfaction which is difficult to define, since a large part of it loses touch with materialism.\nSo, I aligned my line of thought with loving the work we do. If a farmer spends the day on their field, and they enjoy it, then it’s good, isn’t it? How about the software engineer who thinks their technology can help people or maybe due to some other reason, they find love in the code, they write? I found that it was closer to being a ubiquitous activity which can keep people happy, or at least a large number of humans. But then, I saw people who do not have any job at first place. By job, I mean an activity which benefits people and provides something (e.g. salary) in return for the individual. But there are wanderers, fakirs, hitchhikers and many types of unemployed people. So, are they different from regular? These people challenged the universality of this line of thought.\nIt further gave me an idea that instead of (or along with) loving the work, we also need to enjoy with the peers who surround us. So, a lot of human beings are embraced by their parents, friends and/or children. It does not happen always, but we can still find some of these in different bandwidths of our life. It reminded me of the letter by Richard Feynman, Do not remain nameless to yourself. So yeah, Living in love can be a universal thing to do. And it allowed me to picture this massive population of ours on the planet earth. But then, I found exceptions. I thought of Chris McCandless (Into the wild) and how he did not find love in his family but Nature.\nA scene from the movie Into the WildI was back to square one. Do we need another human being to live this life, happily? People can not always surround us. And further, outside of seven billion humans, there are other lives as well. What about dogs, or the trees, plants, and flowers which are alive? Or a lost animal somewhere in the jungle. Do they have to have a peer to share the love or their pursuit of happiness?\nMy problem set got bigger, and I appreciated how difficult it must be for a democracy to form its constitution or King Hammurabi to write his code. At this point, I felt a little exhausted in finding the answer to my question (it had been several months by now).\nBut a few days ago, as I was practicing Vipassana Meditation, I had an epiphany about the question. I realized how much did I miss to observe about my own physical body even when there was so much going on already. I never noticed my breath on its whole (trust me, when I say, I still have not). The moment we start to breathe in, and it goes on for a full length, and then it stops. A moment of no activity, and then we breathe out. And the cycle repeats. Breathing is just one of the many involuntary signs of life, and yet it goes on unnoticed. It made me regard the totality around me, even more. To mention a few, the breeze which blows past me when I stroll on 2.2, the distant sound I listen to while typing this text, the leaves which fall off from the trees when I sit with a cup of chai at Bhaski’s, and other many signs of life.\nI think, for the question of “What is something which should be the universal action of everyone?”, I can put it in words as “To witness”. We necessarily do not have to think, question, or react to the activities around us or even inside us, but to just witness the presence of life.

It’s a social network after all. And it’s also alright if you click a cute picture of a child you spotted in a village. It’s great. Likeways, it’s okay if you post a picture of your own child.

Go to https://github.com. Pick a username, enter your email id and choose a password. Next, choose unlimited personal repositories for free. In the final step you can give some input to github and voila ! You are now a github user. (If you are redirect from KWoC, use the username there.) There is plethora of git guides over internet, some are really good and some really suck. I here am writing a simple blog for the newbies who have successfully made an account over github and are really excited about it.\n GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers some of the distributed revision control and source code management(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration\nOr simply\nGithub connects you with other people who are interested in sharing and creating together.\nSo there are really two ways to begin with. Here goes the first one.\nCreate a repository : Repository is what you call the stuff you are going to upload and work on. Go to https://github.com/new and create a repository. Let’s name it hello-world. Add some description, or you might want to add it later. Initialize it with a Readme. It\u0026rsquo;s a good practice and let\u0026rsquo;s you clone it immediately. (Yeah right, see below)\nClone it : Open your console, move to the directory where you want to work and do this.\n$ git clone https://github.com/username/hello-world.git  This will create a directory in your computer. Now, this isn’t a simple directory. It is a ‘clone’ of the github repository. You can say that the files in it are controlled by the version control system git and tracked with the repository on github. Note : If you have not installed git, see this.\nDo this,\n$ cd hello-world $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/hello-world.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/hello-world.git (push)  This shows that the link to repository of yours at github is known by the name origin over here.\nNow, you will have to configure your name and your email address which you will be using for making the commits (don’t worry about what it means right now, we will cover it soon). This configuring is ideally done only once in a lifetime of your system (or unless you purposely remove your ~/.gitconfig file but that’s the story of another time).\n$ git config --global user.name \u0026quot;ABC XYZ\u0026quot; $ git config --global user.email \u0026quot;abc@xyz.com\u0026quot;  Now another way of this is first you create the directory on your computer. Navigate inside it and do\n$ git init  This will initialize an empty git repository inside it. Later, you can add the link to the repository by the git remote command like this\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/hello-world  You can always use git remote -v command to track the aliases.\nMaking the first change : Okay now we are in condition of adding some files or code to this repository. I am going to make a python file with hello world program and publish the change over the github repository too. So make a new file say hello.py inside the directory, open it with your favorite editor and write the one line code to print whatever you want. Why just hello world? (Because dmr did it!) Now write it and save the file.\nThe first thing you should always do is to see whether you have done any changes or not in the repository. This can be done by\n$ git status\nAfter the changes you made, you must be getting this after git status\nOn branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. Untracked files: (use \u0026quot;git add \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026quot; to include in what will be committed) hello.py nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \u0026quot;git add\u0026quot; to track)Add, Commit, Push! : In your console, do this. $ git add .  This adds all the files in the track which you have changed. Now it’s time to commit that change. By committing, git understands that you want the change to be in record. Every commit is accompanied with a message that appears on the log (git log). A commit should represent one logical change only which should be supported by a relevant commit message. The convention is to write the commit in the verbal form ie. tell the computer to do that for you. Do this\n$ git commit -m \u0026quot;add hello.py\u0026quot;\nYou’ve made your first commit! But it won’t be appearing over github, because you made the changes locally. You need to push it over the web. For that, you use\n$ git push\nOr,\n$ git push origin\nto say git where actually you are pushing it to. Or,\n$ git push origin master\nto say git over what branch on origin you are pushing it to.\nThat’s it! You’ve published your changes to your GitHub repository.\nNOTE : This is a very basic start. There are more concepts to be explored. You can search for specifics. StackOverflow also has great resources. We’ll leave the nitty gritties of Git for another day.\nHappy Coding!\n","date":1485302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485302400,"objectID":"67efc312fe60ad84d5a3dbacfa3c8f3b","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/quick-guide-to-git-and-github-1/","publishdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/quick-guide-to-git-and-github-1/","section":"post","summary":"Before we start, make sure you have an account on GitHub.

Just 30 minutes later, when the crescent rays will fall on the black hood covering your face, when you’ll be tied with, or rather “in” a knot, for the second time of your life, believe me you would not want to be in haste. You don’t want them to see your eyes popped out, or your filthy tongue stuck out like a creep right? So, get up, go get your hair combed, your teeth cleaned, and most importantly collect as much happy thoughts as possible in your stupid brain.”\nThe only child of his parents, this kid was a loner, an antisocial introvert who liked to stay back in his shady living-slash-playing room, and wished to stay there for lifetime. Skipping school since the fourth grade, his mother very well accepted his social awkwardness as well as his mind’s disability and was happy with hiding it from the rest of the world. Whilst I, I watched him grow, I kept calling out for him, in his good times, or bad. I lived in him.\nWhen he was 10, his mother was relocated to a new place, around 50 kilometres from the capital, a place where neighbourhood was as far as the corner shop in the hometown. He was terrified. He had to greet the visitors all along. It was then, he met his first friend, a girl. After she came into his life, there was no shady place, in his house, or heart or anywhere. ‘I love when Vaidehi blinks and smiles at the same time’, he’d say to his mom. One day, it was evident to him, that Vaidehi had the most beautiful eyes he’d ever seen. I still remember how his mother must have felt when she would have realised that his son had one more best friend now.\nHis mother was long gone before he’d even think of proposing Vaidehi to marry. It was the same girl, the only girl he’d ever spoken two words to. He left his mother’s house and starting living with her at a completely new place. ‘I’ve kept your lunch in the kitchen, heat it carefully, okay? I’ll be back by 7\u0026rsquo;, she used to say every morning to him, like a mother warning his kid before herself going out.\nApart from his “work from home” job, he was passionate about clicking pictures. Or rather, he liked to save the moments he was enjoying with her. Some days, he used to shuffle between them, recollect the memories, shed a few tears, curl up on the bed and just wait for her to come in the evening. He was also good at dodging off important calls.\nBest were the college days, when he started perceiving how real, the real world was. He was afraid on the first day. Four years later, he had a job, a “work from home” job, a girlfriend, and no family. But he had learnt how to ignore bullies and be in love, or at least that’s what he’d think.\n‘Come in the City Hospital ASAP. Your wife is here.’ Some lady spoke on the phone. The call was from Vaidehi’s number. He rushed out, alone in the traffic and around so many people. He was little mad at her, why she didn’t take time off work during her last months.\n‘It’s a baby girl’, The nurse announced.\n‘Let’s call her Gayatri’, Vaidehi said.\n‘That’s a beautiful name’\n‘It’s your mother’s.’\n‘Oh yes. Of course.’\nAs the Judge broke the nip of the pen, he declared : ‘According to the evidences presented by the accused himself and his self-admittance, the suspect, on charge of murdering his wife and his baby child, is hereby sentenced to be hanged till death on the month’s last day at sunrise. May God have mercy upon his soul.’\nShe was drunk. One day, when she came home. Or maybe high, he could not figure, he remembers, during college days, she had mentioned one of her female friend who was into heroin at those times.\nVaidehi’s call history. Her friend’s name in recent calls. She was definitely high.\nHe could not dare speak a word to her. He made sure the little girl is fast asleep.\nShe started abusing herself on daily basis. He was worried. He considered himself to be at fault. Maybe, she was not enjoying with him as much as he was. Maybe she didn’t love him like he did.\n‘Nah! That can’t be it.’\nGayatri got into kinder garden. More house chores. Vaidehi couldn’t find time to visit her friend these days. She did go to work, but usually cut short her work hours in the evening. She was not happy.\n‘I will make her feel good.’ Maybe one more kid? Maybe pregnancy will stop her from drugs? He knew if he’ll ask her, she would politely refuse or unwillingly agree considering her husband’s wish. Let it be an accident. Months passed, he started worrying. Nothing happened. How about a medical check-up?\n‘I’m sorry sir, but you are infertile’, the doc said.\nWithin seconds, the first face to appear in front of him, was of his cute little daughter, Gayatri.\nCall history. Her friend’s name is still there. Ring, ring. ‘Hello?’, a hoarse voice; shocked to the bottom of his hearts. It was of a man.\nThis is about the night, the night he became the “accused”. Vaidehi was chopping off vegetables in the kitchen. He was looking at Gayatri, smiling, wondering. He could not hold any longer. He sneaked in.\n‘Hey’\n*’Sorry I got late, had lots of pending work at office. Dinner would be ready soon. I’m preparing noodle soup and rice. *\n‘I had to talk to you about something. I am sorry.’\nShe stopped. ‘What happened?’\n‘I am sorry, I checked your email.’ His heartbeat racing fast.\n‘Why the fuck would you do that?! And so what?’. She put the knife back on the table and stepped towards him.\n‘I saw the notice from your office. They said you haven’t showed up in two weeks.’\nShe was Numb. His legs were trembling.\n‘Vaidehi, you love me right?’\n‘Yes’, her lips were straight.\nHe went straight to bed. Later that morning he woke up, to find himself alone. She was gone with Gayatri. The knife had cut real deep. It was a bloody mess. He fainted.\n“What type of a person you are! That woman had no love for you, but why are you still doing this for her? Just go home already.”\nThe thick rope got around his neck. Eyes closed, hood on, memories started flashing in. And then came the regret, the regret that he would have loved Gayatri more, both of them.\n","date":1484870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484870400,"objectID":"c0d1326c9ebafef69ee4ffd6878ff84d","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/erotomania/","publishdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/erotomania/","section":"post","summary":"“Hey Wake up!\nWake up, for you are left with just 30 more minutes.\nYou better sleep after this is over; rather that would be your only choice.

Neck like a swan or even more beautiful, those elegant lips and yes, those tiny eyes, oh! I was feeling dizzy. For long you weren’t noticing me, maybe because I was not turned on. Thank god! Within few minutes the power was back and I lit myself as intense as I could. I felt more happy than I was before, more alive than I was ever. You had made an impact on me.\nAnd finally, our eyes met! I never felt so boozed up before then. Couple of my heartbeats were skipped. I was losing balance over the amount of current I was intaking. That made me fluctuate before you which would have hurt your eyes. But you kept looking at me or I should say I was getting nervous. Were you in love too? Did you like me too? But very soon you were carried away in the kitchen. You left me confused. And the sad part is, I never saw you even once since then.\nFinally, tonight it’s going to be the last night in my house. 3 days ago, our madam took a picture of me. I didn’t know why.

Due to my recent interests in Image Processing, I had made few Pull Requests to the scikit-image library, but it did not participate in GSoC. And that, after all those years of consecutive partcipation! (Yes I felt little sad.)\nSo, the day when Google announced the list of organizations, I started my “org hunt” ! And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project Library of Time Series methods. The project was to make a library with methods useful to the research in X-ray astronomy. I was thrilled by the idea! Nevertheless, I was not much aware of the astronomical aspects of it.\nIn next 10–15 days, I submitted my proposal and few Pull Requests, among which I think refactoring the Lightcurve class helped me understand the core of the library. In the pre-GSoC period, I also contributed in establishing Continuous Integration with Travis for Unix and Appveyor for Windows. Meanwhile, Stingray, the library we were working on, was re-designed to become an Astropy affiliated package.\nIn the wee hours of April 23, the results were announced and I was selected! My primary and helping mentors were Daniela Huppenkothen and Matteo Bachetti, both from different time zones, which really helped me in getting my answers as soon as possible.\nIn the first ten days of the Community Bonding period, my end semester exams were going on. The main medium of the communication between my mentors and me was Slack. And I must say, we totally loved it.\nI started off with implementing Cross Spectra, basing to a lot of work that was previously done by Abigail Stevens. Later on, Coherence and Lags were added in the Crossspectrum class, along with their tests and docstring.\nAfter the mid-terms the major work was to add the Covariance spectra, and its “Averaged” counter part as well, along with errors for both. My final PR was to add the simple matrix of Dynamical Powerspectrum, which is open as of now.\nThroughout this period, I was able to open 22 Pull requests and push 116 commits to the main repository i.e. StingraySoftware/Stingray.\nOne thing that I would like to share, of many things which I learnt in this perioid, is that numpy booleans are little tricky. For e.g.\nIn []: np.isfinite(100) is True Out[]: False  This is because np.isfinite or similar functions do not return the basic Python bool but an instance of numpy bool. And in the __eq__ magic method of the numpy bool class, it is evaluated to the Python booleans. And so, np.isfinite(100) == True would return True.\nThat is all for now. It was a great experience for me, and I am very thankful to Daniela, Matteo and Abigail for all the help during the summer.\nCheers!\n","date":1484870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484870400,"objectID":"96bdc413a637e6b22b3431922b85523c","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/gsoc2016-report/","publishdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gsoc2016-report/","section":"post","summary":"It began 5 months ago, in February.

Oh this looks so lame.\nIf you’re amateur enough, not to feel uncomfortable after pushing those files, you’re golden. Else, you’ll think of something called .gitignore which helps in ignoring unwanted files to be added in your git repository.\nYou’ll then search for a good gitignore file for Python and Google will give you exactly what you want, Python.gitignore.\nwget -O .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore git add -A git commit -m \u0026quot;Added .gitignore file\u0026quot;  Now, you’ll try to remove the pyc files, using rm -rf *.pyc.

You’ll make a few calls and send messages to people, and say “gitignore is not obeying me”, and they’ll hang up on you, saying “it must be your fault”.\nBelieve me, even the “future me” would have said the same.\nSo, the problem is that once you have staged a file, gitignore won’t have anything to do with it. So, if you’ll remove the staged file (pyc files, in this case), git will say to you that you’ve deleted them.\nLater on, I googled the string “gitignore not working” and O thanks to stackoverflow, I was rescued.\nAfter adding the .gitignore, simply do this\ngit rm -rf --cached . git add .

There is no way this 7 years old editor is going to compete with 39 years old emacs and 15 years old fork of yet another 39 years old editor vi. Nevertheless, there’s much more to come.\nThe first thing that Sublime Text lovers say about vim and emacs is “Why should I open an editor which I don’t know how to get out of?” Fair enough. They are not mere text editors. They have built-in code to edit any external code. Isn’t that pretty? Well, you have to follow some steps to close it. (Or you can forcefully shut down your console anytime you want. No matter they are powerful, you belong to the human race.) They also have more powerful features which make its user’s life easy.\nBut before you’ll think of your easy life, they’ll make you hate your life first. As Pascal Precht in one of his blogs discuss about the learning curve wall of vim. Here is a picture which is very explanatory.\nThe next argument by emacs users are “We don’t like using touchpad and want everything right there in our editor, like mail, news, everything!”\nYou are great sir! But let me also tell you, you are rare and have wrong conclusion about sublime users. We aren’t fond of touchpad either! As of me, I survived a whole semester of college with my touchpad not working. But that doesn’t mean I moved to emacs or vim. subl to open, pgup pgdn and arrow keys for navigation, ctrl + s to save, ctrl + t for new tab, I mean I had got everything done with my keyboard and the fact is that Chrome also obeys these commands (or vice-versa). Imagine you scrolling through a webpage and wondering why j and k are not helping you.\nThe point I’m trying to make is why shouldn’t we encourage newbies to use the editor which makes their life really easy very fast so that they could simply learn how to code rather then learning how to code to code. Later on, let them decide whether they really dislike this editor and move on to something more challenging and I believe some people will surely move on to the challenging ones.\nBut I will surely not.

” , एक बूढी औरत ने पूछ ही डाला।\n“ फुलिया मिस्त्री की बेटी हूँ । ”, रानी ने एक औपचारिक मुस्कान के साथ उत्तर दिया ।\n“ हसनपुर वाले फुलिया मिस्त्री की ?”\n“ जी ”\n“ बड़े विचारवान *रहलें तोहार पिता जी । महतारियो के भी बहुत बढ़िया सुभाव-विचार है तोहार । ”, *उस बूढ़ी औरत ने रानी के लिए थोड़ी सांत्वनाएं जुटायीं ।\nरानी जब छोटी थी तब उसके पिता जी का खेत में पानी चलाने वाले बोरिंग जनरेटर के साथ हादसे में अकाल मृत्यु हो गयी । रानी की माँ एक अत्यंत सरल और दयावान औरत थीं । गाँव में एक बेटे को ही असली वारिस समझा जाता है, लेकिन उन परिस्थितियोँ में भी रानी ने अपने पिता की अंतिम अग्नि खुद दी थी ।\nहाई-स्कूल पर ट्रेक्टर (गाड़ी ) ने लाकर छोड़ दिया । अपना थैला उठाके , वहाँ से वो अपने हवाई चप्पल को धीरे — धीरे मिटटी के बने एक-पगिया रास्ते पर रखते हुए, अपने घर की ओर चल दी । शाम का वक़्त था , गाँव के बुजुर्ग घर के दालान पर लकड़ी के बने मचान के ऊपर रेडियो लिए विविध-भारती का सीधा प्रसारण सुन रहे थे । औरतें दीये , लाल्टेन इत्यादि जला कर , सभी घरों में रौशनी दिखा रही थीं । बूढ़ी औरतें लोटे में पानी भर कर , उसको हाँथ की उँगलियों से ढक के, आँगन में थोड़ा — थोड़ा पानी छिड़क रही थीं। न जाने कितने दिनों बाद रानी को वो भीनी खुसबू नसीब हुई होगी । कुछ दालानों पर मास्टर जी कुर्सी पर बैठ के कुछ बच्चों को गणित का पहाड़ा याद करवा रहे थे , तो कहीं कुछ लड़के ताश का खेल खेल रहे थे। तभी रानी के पैर किसी चीज़ से भिड़ गया । नीचे मुड़ के देखा तो मिटटी में लिप्त एक खिपली (ईंट का टुकड़ा) पड़ा था। उसे देख रानी के मन में न जाने कितनी यादें फिर से सांस लेने लगीं। कुछ देर के लिए मन दौड़ पड़ा , उसी खिपली को हाँथ में लिए , बाल की दोनों चोटियों को हवा में लहराए , एक बारह साल की रानी बन जाने को। गाँव का एक बहुत ही प्रसिद्ध खेल है किथ — किथ जिसे अंग्रेजी में hopscotch या stapoo भी बोलते हैं, जिसे एक पैर पे खड़े हो के , एक खिपली के सहारे खेला जाता है। कोई ठोस वजह तो नहीं लेकिन यह खेल लड़कियों में ज्यादा प्रचलित है।\nउस खिपली को अपने पर्स में रख कर रानी अपने घर की और बढ़ी। आकाश छूता शीशम का पेड़ और गेंदे की फूल की खुसबू से कोई भी फुलिया मिस्त्री का घर पहचान ले । खुर्पी — कुदाल के सहारे अपने हाथों से बनाये हुए छोटे खेत में उसकी माँ ने बैंगन , मूली , मिर्च आदि उगा रखे थे। वहीं मचान पर माँ ने शायद कुछ बना के सूखने को दे रखा था. “*पापड़ मालूम पड़ता है।”, *मन में सोचते हुए रानी अंदर घुसी तो देखा माँ पड़ोस के किसी लड़की के साथ, चौखट पर बैठ के लूडो खेल रही थी। माँ का लूडो बोर्ड अब भी वही है, बस उसपे अनगिनत सेलो टेप की सजावट है ।\n“ अरे रानी तू ! कैसे आना हुआ रे ? एक चिट्ठी से संदेशा भी नहीं भिजवाया तूने तो। आ, बैठ। “, माँ चटाई पर से उठते हुए बोली।\nपड़ोस वाली लड़की लूडो समेट कर अपने घर को चल दी। वहीं माँ का चेहरा इस उम्र में भी छोटे बच्चे की तरह खिल उठा था।\n“रुक मैं अभी निम्बू तोड़ के लाती हु, सरबत बनाने के लिए “\n*“अरे माँ , रहने दो न “ *— जब तक रानी कुछ बोल पाती, बिना चप्पल पहने ही ,उसकी माँ निम्बू तोड़ने के लिए घर के पीछे वाले बागीचे को प्रस्थान कर चुकी थी।\nरानी ने अपने हाथ पैर धुले, भगवान् घर जा कर कुल देवी और अपने पिता की तस्वीर को नमन किया, फिर रसोई घर से एक कटोरे में दो ग्लास पानी भर लिया। एक नज़र दौड़ाया तो उसे चीनी का डब्बा दिखा। मात्र आधे चम्मच चीनी शेष थी उसमें।\nउस सरबत को तो माँ के प्यार ने मीठा बनाया था।\nरानी शाम ढलते ही अपने बचपन की सखियों के घर चल दी। आज न जाने कितने दिनों के बाद उसे अपने सर पे आँचल की फ़िक्र नहीं थी और न ही घर वापस आने की जल्दी।\n","date":1484870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484870400,"objectID":"cea63d132e6a30c8165ec66dff73f22d","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/rani/","publishdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/rani/","section":"post","summary":"Dedicated to all the nameless young girls out there in our villages\nआज वर्षों बाद, रानी अपने मायके जा रही थी । ट्रेक्टर (गाड़ी) पर सवार , उसके साथ की औरतों को बड़ी अनूठी लग रही थी उसका बाहरी सजावट । भला एक हाथ में तीन चूड़ियां कोई पहनता है क्या ! इसकी माँ ने इसे बताया नहीं कितना अशुभ होता है । दुसरे में चार थीं, दो लाल, एक पीली और एक हरे रंग की ।","tags":[],"title":"रानी (Rani)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Non-Tech"],"content":"तसव्वुर से उसके ही कुछ, यूँ उतर के तुम उसके नज़रों से छल करती ,\n\nआज छज्जे पे बैठ के उसके दिल का, अकस्मात् टोह क्यों ले रही\n\nयाद है वो मेले में इनायत थी मिली उसे जो गुब्बारों की सनसनी दौड़ में आतिशबाजियों के बीच मन विक्षिप्त कर दिया था तुमने\n\nजब संगम के किनारे उस शांत\nमदमस्त हवा के बीच सलीके में लब काँप उठे थे उसके\n\nप्रेम की चरमसीमा थी वो या अमरसंगीत का शुभारम्भ जब घाट पर उस दिन तुम्हारा मोती चुरा कर उसने अपनी रूह के संग\nजलाया था तुम्हे\n\nउन्हीं लबों से उसने सुरा उतारी थी भीतर वो दोस्त ही तो थे जो प्रेम के छाये में भी सूरज को मुट्ठी में लिए फिरते थे\n\nआओ उड़ चलें फिर इस मसान से कहीं दूर लौट आएंगे जब तुम थक जाओगी अकेले गोते लगाते लगाते\n\n","date":1479945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479945600,"objectID":"97d1e002744512053759619fd7d71626","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/post/masaan/","publishdate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/masaan/","section":"post","summary":"तसव्वुर से उसके ही कुछ, यूँ उतर के तुम उसके नज़रों से छल करती ,\n\nआज छज्जे पे बैठ के उसके दिल का, अकस्मात् टोह क्यों ले रही\n\nयाद है वो मेले में इनायत थी मिली उसे जो गुब्बारों की सनसनी दौड़ में आतिशबाजियों के बीच मन विक्षिप्त कर दिया था तुमने\n\nजब संगम के किनारे उस शांत\nमदमस्त हवा के बीच सलीके में लब काँप उठे थे उसके","tags":[],"title":"मसान (Masaan)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Non-Tech"],"content":"\u0026ldquo;First brush your teeth, then touch anything,\u0026rdquo; Mommy used to say whenever I tried to sneak in to the kitchen for the Diwali sweets.

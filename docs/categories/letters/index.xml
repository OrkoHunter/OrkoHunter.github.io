&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Himanshu,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for joining Spotify. We really miss you at college. You&amp;rsquo;re one of the few seniors at KGP from whom I got really influenced in making changes in my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of writing a letter to you since a few months as a chat/talk cannot convey the message with proper bandwidth. I wanted to talk about a lot of things. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a purpose per se. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I regret now that would be making myself away from you guys during my first year because of the intoxicated activities xD. I used to judge people blindly on the basis of their habits and think my parents are always right. As I grow up, I realise that not a single one has any idea of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing in their life, how things progress and end. Everyone learns from their experiences and they think if they could change a decision that they took in the past, they could&amp;rsquo;ve avoided some problems in the present but that would erase a lot of things they&amp;rsquo;ve gained from their problems. This statement came from a show that I&amp;rsquo;ve watched recently called Dark by Netflix. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of psychology recently and I realised that everyone who I thought was doing good has a lot of insecurities and they keep doing things having faith in their values, finding happiness in their small wins after the hardships and it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting confused a lot recently. I watched a show called Bojack Horseman and it was so depressing. Whenever I watch a single episode, I used to relate myself to the character who is a horse which always says things about life in a doomer way. I decided to read whenever I&amp;rsquo;m confused and not feel bad about feeling bad about myself. Whenever I feel like reading something, I either take my kindle or read an article from the internet. I&amp;rsquo;ve read your blog posts and letters multiple times and each time I read, I get a new insight. Thanks for writing those. I&amp;rsquo;m always intrigued by the way you write things in your blog. I hope that&amp;rsquo;s how you think. It&amp;rsquo;s really minimal and the flow of thoughts is incredibly linear. I read a book called Think Straight by Darius Foroux last year and it feels simple to do that, but not easy. I was curious to know how I think and how contaminated my thoughts are. I recently did a dopamine detox. It&amp;rsquo;s more than a digital detox. I stayed away from my laptop, phone, television, kindle, instant gratification activities, talking with people, tea/coffee, etc. for 24 hours. Things I did were meditating and documenting my thoughts. Documentation of thoughts to clear the mind and to learn how you think is called brain vomit. I read about this somewhere from the internet. I always used to reset myself once in a week by smoking up and it does just the opposite of dopamine detox. But this thing was hard. I ended up meditating thrice. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use an app or a specific technique per se. I was just accepting my thoughts by closing my eyes. So 3x1hr sessions. From the very next day, I felt fresh and relieved. I could do anything I was struggling with before. That frustration whenever I stuck while coding up a problem, the difficulties I faced while reading research papers which made me think about my lack of understanding capacity and whatnot - every distraction was just gone. I did my workout for 1hr followed by the remote work I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to do and read my kindle in between. That day was beautiful. It went exactly as I planned but when I tried to sleep at night, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep. The next day I wasn&amp;rsquo;t insisting to do anything per se. Just did the things I felt like doing but I turned off the push notifications on my phone and used the internet when it was necessary only. I could sleep at that night very well. I felt interesting to experiment the things out of the books I read about habits. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the one suitable for me. I should adapt slowly by accepting my imperfections I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m closing this letter with this last paragraph. This is about things just getting right and suddenly everything goes wrong but still managing to breathe. When I visited New York for a code sprint last year, I was mind blown by the things I saw there. I wanted to visit the US again. I&amp;rsquo;d dreamed of settling there. So, I started working hard with the research and it took more than two months to get two of the FTs accepted with funding. There are long stories behind that. But that would make this letter even longer. So, I&amp;rsquo;m omitting those. I&amp;rsquo;d to setup my BTP also and I wanted to do that in CS dept. I sent mails to some profs, some didn&amp;rsquo;t reply, some replied negatively and one replied positively asking me to meet him in the office. I&amp;rsquo;d hopes on him but he humiliated me instead there. I was like I am not good enough, I should be doing most of the people are doing and couldn&amp;rsquo;t aim big. On the last date of application submission, I mailed a prof who didn&amp;rsquo;t even reply once before and was not found in his office whenever I tried to meet him. I mailed him just for the sake of it as my facad told me that he would extend the deadline if I forward him a mail to a prof asking for BTP. Unexpectedly, he agreed to mentor me. Suddenly everything felt like were going exactly as I planned. The very next day US declared emergency because of covid and I just can&amp;rsquo;t go there for my summers. They agreed to mentor me remotely though. I reached home just before the lockdown and it&amp;rsquo;s been two months now. My parents are really happy to have me around. They&amp;rsquo;re afraid of me getting away from them. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard to work from home. This covid made me afraid to settle abroad and still got me confused. This letter turned out to be really long and contain a lot of personal information. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do that on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-responded--&#34;&gt;I responded -&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi :name-retracted:,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for writing this letter. Also, thank you for opening up and sharing the thoughts from your mind. This is a rare pleasure. Let me try to reciprocate! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first saw you on a Metakgp demo day event and I have been fascinated by you since then. Those were the early years of KOSS. I was looking for people in KGP who resonated with the idea. I would always carry a mental model of students with me who were perfect for a community like KOSS and people who would definitely enjoy being there. What you were in your first year, soon became the face of my mental model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your experience, intellect and ability to communicate, you are easily someone I wanted to be in my first year. I am glad our efforts and the people involved in the KGP Open Source community fascinated you and now we are close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you wrote above related to intoxication made me so excited! They have been some of my favourite topics to talk about. Externally it looks like a conversation about having a drink early in college, but the bigger picture is more about waking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe most of us in our first year are not awake in many senses. Just after the restless two years of the grand exam preparation, we are not ready to own our thoughts and actions. We eagerly seek advice, for someone to answer us &amp;ndash; What now?. We are sensitive and vulnerable to our surroundings. Some of us use the words of our parents and guardians as the governing principles of our life. Some of us blindly follow the first few seniors that we meet and spend our whole college life doing things which we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done otherwise. This is harmful in many ways but not necessarily bad for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about life in college, I am currently reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs&#34;&gt;Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson&lt;/a&gt;. The pages about his college life are inspiring to me. I would not do everything that he used to do (Extreme diets, sleeplessness, not showering, being rude to parents/people in general), but his energy and attitude towards life defined him in those moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young students of IITs refusing to do some things which the society has asked them not to do, is a grey area to talk about. Without forcing anything on them, I would instead share one of these questions that I asked myself very early in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I thinking for myself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I question everything?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How important is it for me to solve this assignment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What difference will it make if I get a B instead of A or EX grade?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this the best use of my time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I have the right people around me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are my friendships healthy? Am I exploring the depths of my relationships?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I love the work that I do or want to do in future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is that a lot of us start thinking for ourselves sooner or later. But to do it as early as possible is an amazing experience and shows us the parts of life which we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have seen otherwise. To sum it up, I am not directly promoting drinking and smoking up in college. Doing it mindlessly has bad consequences for most of us. They are nothing but a medium for us to start living a free life in a higher state of consciousness. What you have written above about the realisation and acceptance makes you brave, and you should see it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your words about my blog. I am influenced by &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/talk.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s Write Like You Talk essay&lt;/a&gt;. I was in the literary society back in college and I would see writers complicate their pieces by trying to write in a very different, unreal way, which they thought is aesthetic. At the same time, I was fascinated by the poems and proses which were easy to comprehend but much harder to fully understand. Talking about Paul Graham, my favourite essay from him is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/vb.html&#34;&gt;Life is Short&lt;/a&gt;. I keep getting back to this essay every couple months. It is heartfelt advice for people of our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovely to hear about your full day dopamine detox. Damn, I could never do it now. If my mother tried calling me on Whatsapp and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t respond in an hour or two, she will start getting worried. But, I respect the idea. I am also fascinated by the 10 days Vipassana meditation course where we eat less, live in silence and do Vipassana meditation 10 hours per day, to witness thoughts and sensations come and go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that you quit Facebook too. It is amazing how we want to spend a healthy life by being mindful about all the dopamine agents around us. I think one of the worst habits of people (including me) is that we do not respect the time between waking up in the morning and us connecting and catching up with the internet. That period of time determines how the rest of our day will go. Some people call it having a slow morning, which is doing slow, mundane things in that block of time. It includes things like making coffee, making our bed, washing dishes, showering, staring outside at the morning sun, etc. This slowness boosts our energy for the rest of the day. For me, nothing is worse than getting up from bed and scrolling Twitter for 10 minutes straight. That dials down my tempo for hours in the day. You can read more about &amp;ldquo;Slow Morning&amp;rdquo; on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am personally sad to see the effects of COVID-19 on the college students. I feel sad that you didn&amp;rsquo;t get to experience the internship in the US. But I&amp;rsquo;m happy to know that you got to work remotely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your story with the professors back in KGP is disappointing. For me, it has been a vicious circle of me skipping classes and me not learning anything from my professors. The segregation of departments and disciplines is a legacy model and affects many students who want to study subjects outside of our assigned departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me end by mentioning a letter from Richard Feynman called &lt;a href=&#34;https://lettersofnote.com/2015/10/23/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself/&#34;&gt;Do not remain nameless to yourself&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote this to one of his PhD students after winning the Nobel Prize. You might have read this already. It is inspiring for people in Science and Technology. Barriers like nasty professors or broken interview systems will not stop you and me from accomplishing what we want to do. &amp;ldquo;No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&amp;rdquo; Someone as skilful as you should grow thick skin for them and keep working on things that you love. I know you love solving problems and creating software. It should be all that is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely enjoy the time at home with family. Let&amp;rsquo;s keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Recommendation - Man&#39;s Search for Meaning</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/letters/mans-search-for-meaning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/letters/mans-search-for-meaning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear :name-retracted:,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished reading a book today. It’s called &lt;em&gt;Man’s Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt;, written by &lt;em&gt;Viktor Frankl&lt;/em&gt;. He was a German psychiatrist captured by Hitler’s army in one of the most horrific concentration camps. If you are not aware of “The Holocaust,” more than a million people were killed in those concentration camps and more than ten million Jews during World War II. In the Auschwitz concentration camp, he (the author) witnessed so many deaths and brutality during the time he was captured in prison. People were separated from their families and children. They were gassed up and killed if they were unfit for work. Surviving on very little food and medicines, all their lives were a misery. The author saw his companions losing hope for survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save you time from reading it, I will share the things I learned from this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this book as an answer to “Why should we not be depressed?” and a guide to handling other existential questions. One of the most asked questions by the entire humanity is “What is the meaning of my life? What is the purpose of my existence?”. These questions have been here since tens of thousand years. People have created religions to answer these questions. Righteousness (Dharma) and other ethics come out of these religions. Here is what the author says -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no abstract universal meaning to life. We should stop finding it. We do not need to ask this question. But life itself is asking this question from us. We have to answer it ourselves. This question is not ours to ask, but for us to answer. We create our meaning. Whether it is work, love, or courage. We create our “Why” individually. And this “Why” guides us to survive any “How”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds that — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure or a quest for power, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. It can be anything or anyone. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, something which I’ll always try to remember is — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is nothing but a relief, a motivation to lead a peaceful and meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I thought upon how we are raised, I noticed that our parents, teachers, and well-wishers try to inflict us with what gave meaning to their lives. My grandfather found purpose in a well-paid job because he had a sizeable low-income family to feed. That was it. He is 88 years old now, and the meaning of life still hasn’t changed for him. My father finds the purpose of life in a loving family. Everyone should talk to each other and support each other in their difficult times. I don’t know why he does that, but that is what I am aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of those two are correct nor incorrect. As an individual, I respect what drives them. But every time my grandfather says “I wish you get crores rupees of salary and stand 1st in your college”, I smile and silently disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So :name-retracted:, the next time you think of something which you have not achieved, which makes you feel you have not been successful, which threatens your self-esteem, take a minute and ask yourself “Is this or will this be meaningful to me?”. Meaningful doesn’t mean enjoyable but fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care,

      <title>On Psychedelics</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/letters/on-psychedelics/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/letters/on-psychedelics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-wrote--&#34;&gt;I wrote -&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello :name-retracted:!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I watched the movie Her. It was a fascinating movie on emotions and AI. It was one of its kind and made me think a bit. Humans created a consciousness in the movie, and at one point it started wondering about itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a lot of humans, at some point in their lives, think about the purpose of their lives (Hilariously reminds me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7HmltUWXgs&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;You pass butter&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;). I found myself in the situation for the first time right after JEE, but later I forgot as programming happened to me. And then, again after reading Sapiens this December. And now, it&amp;rsquo;s stuck in my head. It&amp;rsquo;s not always a negative thought, a lot of times I happen to be smiling and puzzled as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad psychedelics exist in the world. It made me constantly aware of the mysterious and unknown, made me witness colors never seen before, geometries beyond apprehension, and gifted a broad palette of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often at times, I self-construct arguments against psychedelics being good and then later work on the counter-arguments. I have an interesting thought to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of our ancient tradition. Children during their brahmacharya were recommended to have a Guru. It was a norm to grow up having a guru. In the case of Eklayva, his teacher was a statue, not a living person. So, Guru was a concept but mostly found in the form of life. I highly recommend a thoughtful psychedelic experience to my friends once in life. I ask them to respect what they think of intaking. I believe these chemicals and plants have the potential to be the guru in this modern age. That is the thought. Also, not all teachers and teachings are good (thus, Bad Trips), but there is always a lesson to learn, always a lesson to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;name-retracted-responded&#34;&gt;:name-retracted: responded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and gifted a broad palette of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the emotions I have collected from the small out-of-world experience I had is the best thing I kept with myself after the trip. Now I listen to the same music with more intense emotions. Now I live the same life with more vividness. (And the most wonderful thing about reading your mail is: I hadn&amp;rsquo;t given many thoughts how these emotions emerged, I will now. Surely, these trips have changed my composition as human. (Romantic ahaa!))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have our unique mental models about the world and there are a lot of mental models trying to dictate our ways through life. (Most people aren&amp;rsquo;t even aware of them. - I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware until I went for that Himachal trip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: the usage of &amp;lsquo;we&amp;rsquo; everywhere is a small mental model about the world, watching a series of actions like a sequential programmer is another mental model, trying to optimize petty things, and watching people as a neural network model is another. We had these experiences and we have these models in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the consequences of being from :state-name-retracted:, being a c++/python programmer, competitive programmers, deep learning engineer in the order the examples are given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I took pyshedelics, I created another mental model. It is about open-mindedness. It is compassionate and weak as a twig, at the same time it is strong as the storms. It embraces other mental models and tries to break them from bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken it, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have come out from the clutches of commitment. Staying in commitment for the sake of it is biased. (Commitment in itself is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are about to break a commitment, there is a lot of &amp;lsquo;socio-cultural&amp;rsquo; norms to stop you. More than anything, it is your mind asking you not to do it for the sake of &amp;lsquo;moral&amp;rsquo; compass you have set. Then you realize &amp;lsquo;love&amp;rsquo; is greater than any norms/compass and that love shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make you feel mediocre. I realized I feel more loved(more dopamine) when I see the white moon by the trees than her (This was the snap moment, our last LSD trip). I had written a small sentence during those time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kahu kaise tujhe ki ek samandar se sukoon mila par dhoop nikalne pe wapas jana hai&amp;rdquo; (Hindi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you hate the ocean, that you have suddenly started hating it. It&amp;rsquo;s just that if &amp;lsquo;love&amp;rsquo; is there, you&amp;rsquo;ll carry the essence of the oceans within you, wherever you go.
Everyone carries something, and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t carry the things just for the sake of carrying(commitment just for the sake of commitment) but only if you want to (love).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always a tiny bit confused in this matter. There is yet some fingerprints on the glass, next psychedelic would help me get it cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is how I used some open-mindedness I gathered from my trips. It shackled some norms set in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend a thoughtful psychedelic experience to my friends once in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify, I would like to add a single point. It&amp;rsquo;s for everyone but not &amp;lsquo;every&amp;rsquo;time. I can provide almost anyone with an LSD but not DMT. Even :name-retracted:, I have never given him DMT. It&amp;rsquo;s just that you have to feel (judge) whether they would embrace what they see. These are tough things we are looking at, it can make people but break them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really believe you already know this but added for the sake of availability bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>It is okay not to be special</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/letters/it-is-okay-not-to-be-special/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/letters/it-is-okay-not-to-be-special/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi :name-retracted:!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I don’t bore you with this letter. I feel like talking to you about life. (Which I always want to do. All the time. It’s almost like I met you yesterday and quickly got comfortable in saying things.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. There we go. There is a married couple somewhere on the outskirts of a town, renting a one bedroom apartment in a 10-story dull looking building. They have a median family income. (Imagine the couple in movie The Lunchbox). The family wakes up and goes to work. The wife prepares and sends him the lunchbox. And she always does thousands of other household chores, which look trivial but are as difficult as any job. The days are tiring. The couple gets together for dinner later in the evening. Let’s say they watch a movie, or a reality dance show with a celebrity guest, or maybe a scheduled TV serial, as usual. And this goes on for a long time. Like, really long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They constantly feel that something is missing. Suddenly, their lives look like an incomplete picture in front of them. They realize maybe they don’t have it all. So they decide to do what billions of us have decided in the past, i.e. to raise a kid. The kid gives them love to share in exchange for some financial load and a whole lot of time from both their lives. But they get happier, or maybe. Their lives go on, a bit busier than before. They are 3 people now. Everything is new to the child, so he/she is excited as hell. But the mundane stuff starts happening again. The dinner, the TV, the feeling of “something missing” from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many of these families never figure out what was missing. I have seen a few. There are millions of them in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this time, these people look at something only to realize, they don’t have it. They look at people in the movies/serials wearing clothes which they don’t have. The house, they don’t have. The parties they don’t go to. Or the romance, as shown in the movies. All of the mainstream media shows them things that they want, but do not have. But the worst part is, that the media tells them that those things exist and there is still hope, most of which is imaginary. So, they live in the expectation of achieving something which does not exist in reality or is too tedious to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known this for a long time. But only now I realize, it’s very natural for us to do that. This has been going on for thousands of years. It’s called the human’s struggle for finding the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think we live with a purpose. And that we were sent with a purpose. We invented religion to make us believe that there is a white-bearded man above the clouds, always looking at us and that he loves all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when a self-awakened man comes and says, “You know what, we don’t exist with any purpose at all”. Or when Carl Sagan tells us about how vast our entire universe is and that we are nothing but pale blue dots in the whole picture; we feel so small. And that’s it. At this point, the one who realizes and accepts that we are not special, is known as a Buddha, and rest of us constantly miss out on life desiring to be special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with not being special?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I am saying all this to you is that I don’t worry about our love not being what it isn’t. I am a simple guy, who thinks about the girl he loves when he wakes up and looks at her picture before going to bed in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think as much as I accept this love as it is, the more joyful I can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bas itna hi kehna tha, kuch jyada shabdon mein :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>The era of fake acquaintance</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/letters/the-era-of-fake-acquaintance/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/letters/the-era-of-fake-acquaintance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-wrote&#34;&gt;I wrote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something provocative happened with me yesterday. I was with :name-retracted: in CCD after you left. We were there for quite some time. Meanwhile, a group of people came in, including a friend from TLS. I went ahead and had a brief conversation with him. But when I noticed, there was one girl in the group whom I also knew! You know her; she is the one from the early times of :group-name-retracted: (I think you met her on :place-name-retracted:). There was a brief moment of eye contact, but it instigated no emotion. I could not even say &amp;ldquo;Hi&amp;rdquo; because of the bland reaction on our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were leaving, we noticed that she was coming out of CCD too. From there to Veggies, :name-retracted: and I walked alongside her. I am not able to forget those 40 seconds; there was too much silence to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is the deal. Somewhere in the datacenters of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of her and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings or bytecodes which either she or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of &amp;ldquo;comment&amp;rdquo; as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that this person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spotted that same person for the first time in months, it was speechless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, there have roughly and popularly been two types of edges between homo sapiens, either they are acquainted with each other, or they are not. For the past decade, a third type has emerged. You know someone on Facebook, you &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; to them, but you don&amp;rsquo;t talk with that passion or eagerness to them in real life with using flesh and bones (Remember :name-retracted:?). For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger lets them use that gif meme to convey. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, simply raises questions on parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make do not physically exist around them. I am definitely not saying one is better than others, there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion over friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a curious homosapien, who used the internet to blab to you about internet. But yes, I know we have to have this conversation when we meet and this exchange of email shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the end, and that makes me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;name-retracted-responded&#34;&gt;:name-retracted: responded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi!
This predicament, as you are feeling, is understandable. The oddity of changing societal rules and relationships, brought about by social-media corporations, is at times overwhelming. But if you try to understand this phenomenon at an abstract level, then perhaps we can get a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have thought to be a &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; acquaintance is not fake per se, but just another expression of the changes that are taking place in our society due to social media. It is at best, friendship in the normal sense of the word or at worst, a &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; acquaintance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity has come so far only because of the large-scale cooperations between diverse groups of people.This cooperation could be achieved, thanks to fictional stories like religions, society, and other collectivities which made it easier for people to trust each other. But as we all know, socio-political evolutions necessitated new stories to bind people together, and in the process, we developed theories like democracy, communism, nation-states to fit the narrative of the time better. So the critical thing to note here is that as the narrative has changed so have the rules governing the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that I want to place your qualms about the internet. The internet is undoubtedly forcing us to adopt a new narrative of our time and respecting the course of history over several millennia; we must be ready to accept this reality and better adapt to the changing times by altering the &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; of the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to the specific case of &amp;ldquo;acquaintance on the facebook but not in real life,&amp;rdquo; I do not find anything odd here. In fact, I find it empowering that acquaintances could be made even without knowing each other in real life. It is for the first time human-history that you can cooperate and collaborate with others, on a large and expansive scale, even without knowing them in real life. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have commonalities like religion, nationalities, ideologies and any other collectivities to come together and cooperate with each other. Cooperation is not predicated on external factors which are not in your control but internal factors that you can control. A person from Pakistan can send me a friend request on facebook, and if I want, I can become his friend and vice-versa. The acquaintance or the friendship, in this case, was established just because two persons wanted to become friends. How improbable this sounds without internet, in the complex realities of our time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to your regret about not talking to them with the same passion in real life, I think here the critical factor being emphasized by you is the emotional content of these acquaintances. That the emotionality of it all is diminishing is what you want to say. But the emotion is just an after-effect. It is not the cause. You become friend with someone because you find something good in them for you and hence better cooperation. That in the end, you develop emotional attachments is just a side-effect in my view. Sometimes these emotions may create a feedback loop and ensure even better cooperation, like two lovers getting married. But unmindful emotions may lead to undesired consequences too, like hyper-nationalists going berserk in their common love for the country. I think, as long as the cause of cooperation is understood well, side-effects like emotions can be controlled or channeled in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techno-humanism aims to enhance human&amp;rsquo;s life using technology and binds humanity in a novel way that breaks the shackles of boundaries between nations, religious differences, and any other differences. In this respect at least, social media like facebook, twitter have done well, irrespective of whether it was their motive or not. Traditional relationships which we are most familiar with are undergoing a paradigm shift, and it&amp;rsquo;s again just a reflection of the changing times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;It is getting long. :P I hope my ramblings did not bore you. Hope to have a wide discussion on it over a cup of tea sometime. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Response to &#39;How is Life?&#39;</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/letters/response-to-how-is-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/letters/response-to-how-is-life/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked &amp;ldquo;How is Life?&amp;rdquo; over chat by someone and I thought of responding with a letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello :name-retracted:,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry it took me so long to respond to you. I was travelling. The same winter vacations, 30 days, and the curiosity of what to do with it. It&amp;rsquo;s astonishing for the old-me that I have no tech goals this time. I have been learning Guitar for a month and hence I tend to practice daily. On the other hand, I have goals of losing weight (lost 6 kgs in 45 days) and hence I&amp;rsquo;m determined to maintain the daily calorie deficit. One of my cousin sisters at home (in :place-name-retracted:) gave birth to a little girl yesterday and I&amp;rsquo;m planning to spend some time with them too! So yeah, this December it&amp;rsquo;s mostly about being with close people and few goals which I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to achieve for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, my thoughts have been revolving around this particular letter&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.toptal.com/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; of Feynman. In which he says, &amp;ldquo;No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&amp;rdquo;. Reading this letter gives me tremendous relief because it settled down some of my uneasiness about something which relates to KGP itself. The general idea of MetaKGP as a group, for me, is a solution to the problem we have in KGP of closed societies and very little collaborative nature among a majority of people. (Of course, it means more). While I understood this problem very clearly, there is always more which have been troubling me since my first year. I still do not understand all of them, but few are &amp;ldquo;the troubled hierarchy and senior-junior relationship in our halls and societies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;lack of human interactions about life and work both&amp;rdquo;. I always have so many people with whom I am able to talk about technology and so many other people with whom I am able to talk about philosophy, but I only have two or three friends with whom I can freely talk both at the same time, which in fact is the real me. And I always believed, for this to take place, we will have to do more than meeting online. (I am literally shaking at this point but this does not reflect on the words I have written so far. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love human interactions more, where more senses are at work than just reading text)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in time in my KGP life, I am certain that it is so much more helpful when you have good seniors with whom you can meet occasionally, curious peers with whom you discuss the questions. I have been blessed to get all of them, the likes of you and :name-retracted:. But this does not happen to everyone. I firmly believe there are people (like me) in my batch, who did not meet enough &lt;em&gt;[insert-an-adjective abstracted by &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo;]&lt;/em&gt; seniors (like I met) and now they come around and call a fellow friend &amp;ldquo;stud&amp;rdquo; while I just wish to join them and not create boundaries and levels between us. One of them ended his life ten months ago. And there are probably more living with the following thoughts. Just to add, I am absolutely not asking everyone to become a tech guy and get seniors who do open source. Few of the best people I have met in KGP do not belong to tech. And it should be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, here is an interesting fact. A majority of my friends who are responsible, who try to understand about life, who are really enjoying this journey are associated with Collaborating in groups and/or doing Open Source software. And I believe this has to be one of the solutions for (some) people and could really help them. My motive to create a closed group of people who understand this problem and are willing to help others, the initiative of KWoC, the sessions etc. are just a bigger picture to my very small zeal of increasing more human interactions in KGP. It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening when a lot of my friends do not understand the efforts or simply do not care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuse me for some arrangement of words which can be put together in a more readable manner and losing my brevity. But I have not talked about this to anyone, except :name-retracted: and that too only once. It will take time for me to organize these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, How is life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.toptal.com/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lettersofnote.com/2015/10/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself.html?m=1&#34;&gt;http://www.lettersofnote.com/2015/10/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself.html?m=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;response-from-name-retracted&#34;&gt;Response from :name-retracted:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey,
Thanks a lot for writing this, the pleasure of receiving a letter isn&amp;rsquo;t something I get often. So, How is life for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such broad questions are easy to ask and way hard to answer, that&amp;rsquo;s why I mostly receive the answer &amp;ldquo;good!&amp;rdquo;. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Blackstratblues, in another tab I have django documentation open which I have to use to complete to order to complete the screening process of Toptal &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.toptal.com/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, and I have been thinking about ways machine learning is wrong I have attached a writeup. I just finished this book called &amp;ldquo;The Black Swan&amp;rdquo; by Nassim N. Taleb you should totally read it, on surface it is about limits of knowledge but I find him to be very profound and his philosophies connect everything in life and universe. He isn&amp;rsquo;t a I know it all pundit rather he talks about what you don&amp;rsquo;t know, what you cannot know and what can you do about it. Of course, as with any book and any author you don&amp;rsquo;t have to agree with everything or even anything the author says but the book will give you a new perspective. I was about to say this perspective is &amp;ldquo;helpful&amp;rdquo; then I remembered my own writing on :blogpost-retracted:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days just after quitting the job were pretty stressful, my parents even convinced me take back my resignation at one point, but now I&amp;rsquo;m glad out of it. My biggest fear at job was that I&amp;rsquo;ll get trapped in it, sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it, I found it to be boring and whatever, but I know myself and I know that I adapt to things slowly as weeks turned into months, months would have turned into years and I would learned to like the job the way it is, extra money, suits, the &amp;ldquo;prestige&amp;rdquo; I had started to develop a taste for them. After sometime that fact that this job was something that I never wanted would have faded way and I would have accepted the most boring parts as part of the parcel, thinking what better can I get. Though it might not look that way from outside, quitting the job was REALLY hard for me, in conventional terms it was the best job I could have got, though I was very clear that this job was not something I wanted but the question was if not this then what? I saw no natural transition either, I interviewed with :company-name-retracted: for tech lead and they didn&amp;rsquo;t take me. One day I was pretty frustrated, I thought if I don&amp;rsquo;t quit now then I&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to quit. I thought about the reasons I should stay, none of them were strong enough, so I resigned next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About opensource, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to add to add to what you said. Just as you are glad to find us, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to find you. As you did, sometimes I look back and realize that I have really really lucky. Things would have been way different if I didn&amp;rsquo;t meet :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: in school, things would have been way different if I, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been my wingies, things would have been way different I hadn&amp;rsquo;t discovered :name-retracted:&amp;rsquo;s blog before coming to KGP which lead to me to discover KLUG. There are many many such lucky things which have happened. Of course there are people who are luckier than me, but there are so many others who aren&amp;rsquo;t. I think it is our responsibility to share this luck so that others can get a chance to get lucky like we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>About Metakgp</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/letters/about-metakgp/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/letters/about-metakgp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can listen to this in background &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J76MeYAGaH8&#34;&gt;Before The Beginning - John Frusciante (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;name-retracted-wrote--&#34;&gt;:name-retracted: wrote -&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this couple of days ago, I wanted to send it to a private chat. But I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can, so I am sending it here. Of all people at MetaKGP, I surely think I can correspond freely with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello :name-retracted:, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted:!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this specifically for you guys because for me MetaKGP has always been defined by you three. (+ :name-retracted: and Himanshu)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this to talk about my tenure and how I feel about MetaKGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the very start, I always wanted to have a hacker experience. To learn and be someone who could build things to make one&amp;rsquo;s life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first year, I refrained from joining other societies and went only for so-called technical societies, I always thought that we have a limited time and time spent on anything else would cut time given to my aim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the second year, being in :hostel-name-retracted:, Me and :name-retracted: found ourselves working together for OpenIIT Data Analytics challenge. I used to complete everything allocated to me. And maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why :name-retracted: called me for a MetaKGP meetup. I was like damn, there are societies other than the research groups working in tech domain. :name-retracted: had asked me to write on the wiki about JCB, personally, I disliked it. Anyway, I completed it. And then wrote a little more on the wiki (I was copying what everyone was doing), but still the memories I cherished about MetaKGP came from the meetings we had, where we discussed possible projects. (I still think how crazy the idea of a 2.2 bot is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw :name-retracted:&amp;rsquo;s :project-name-retracted: script, I was astonished how one can create sessions, log in to ERP and automate so many things. :project-idea-retracted:. I had made something of use, not only for me but for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was a session on sys-admin by :name-retracted:, I tried to learn it, even practiced at room but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get hold of so many things he talked about. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to justify myself here but would definitely say that it was my lack of interest that I didn&amp;rsquo;t give much time to learn it. (At the time I was recently introduced to ML, had mentored the winter workshop on CV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the third year, I think there was a phase shift. Suddenly we were focussing a little more on advertising MetaKGP. It is necessary that people get to know about MetaKGP and our projects, but we were focussed more on advertising than creating value. I am not undermining the ongoing projects, Naarad came to completion during this time, MFQP-source was going strong. But during this time only one of current third year told me during the meeting, &amp;ldquo;Ye meeting me bss fundebaazi chalti rahti hai&amp;rdquo; (He does not come to meeting now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came elections, :name-retracted: asked me and I stood up for contesting. At the same time, Inter-IIT and Inter-Hall OpenSoft were going on, I won&amp;rsquo;t go into much detail but I was very busy. I wrote my proposal in a train journey and sent it to :name-retracted:, I believed that I was going to lose. Even in the vote, I gave myself lowest priority. But thank god I was chosen as a maintainer, I have learned so many things in my tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this also meant that I had to fulfill what I had written in my proposal (Please don&amp;rsquo;t rebuke on this point, I know it is naive of me to think so), So I started the :slack-channel-name-retracted: channel cause I knew that due to my interest I would read about ML and DL every day and hence posting regularly about it would be easier. And I conducted the :event-name-retracted:, I justified myself that I would get to know how senior people work and think. I learnt a great deal from the :event-name-retracted: but accepting their failure, none of them attracted more people to slack. Most of the people who came to :event-name-retracted: were on my personal invitation, even sharing from GymK page didn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summers, :name-retracted: had shifted everything to docker, I thought that this is the time that I can learn about docker and maybe help. I tried to install it, fix some issue. I got stuck somewhere and I left. It was frustrating to work on docker, I just accepted defeat that I won&amp;rsquo;t be of much use for the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming to this year: :name-retracted:, :name-retracted:, :name-retracted:, Himanshu, :name-retracted:, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted:, all of them had been great with me. But we were discussing more and working less. As I have fresh memories for this semester, I can recall that we talked about course reviews but never got them, we talked about a fresher intro we never gave, we talked about myriad things we never did. For me, this clearly shows how I failed as a maintainer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t criticize anyone, this is not a good practice. I tried to work on projects: the :project-name-retracted:(a naive project), the :project-name-retracted:(it was almost completed, I mean it builds and runs, but as CIC already caches YT it is not of much use). We got traffic for MFQP-source (IMO this was awesome on the part of :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: for getting this feat). I contributed to the wiki, hoped that this might inspire people to contribute more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experiences, I would try to draw conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was foolish of me to believe that bringing more people on slack would help MetaKGP, Until and unless we create value there won&amp;rsquo;t be much to bind us. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we need a lot of people for MetaKGP if we have only 3-5 people from each batch that would be more than enough. We need to promote the Hacker culture in KGP, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t specifically means promoting MetaKGP. We conducted few small lightning talk session amongst us friends this semester, I learnt a lot from that. We at MetaKGP need to stop branding ourselves as a society for everyone, We are (or have become) a technical society whose people have interest in everything. We need to focus more on projects, we, maintainers, created a small roadmap in our last meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Incomplete and left]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-responded--&#34;&gt;I responded -&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey :name-retracted:,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard for me to write the words I am about to. It is hard for me to maintain brevity due to multiple strong emotions attached to the subjects. But here I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading your message, One thing that I felt is best described as Sorry. Yeah. I am sorry I did not support you enough on the cab ride with :name-retracted:, even when I wanted to. I am sorry I did not contest in the elections with you or justified my stance publicly of why not to. I am sorry I mostly acted as if &amp;ldquo;you are supposed to&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I might voluntarily&amp;rdquo; for various tasks, events, and responsibilities. This is not how things work. On one hand, we are trying to get new and enthusiastic people, while at the same time, due to the same actions, MetaKGP is turning other people off, who already existed. I am one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I tell you something about Kharagpur Winter of Code? :name-retracted: has started growing a bad taste for it. His problem is &amp;ldquo;Why are we coaching people for GSoC? We should be promoting hardcore Open Source instead.&amp;rdquo; This is where I differ and agree with him at the same time. Yes, we should be promoting hardcore Open Source. But what would be the perfect strategy? Engineers with jobs, when they have an upfront deadline to ship a product and they need a simple NLP date time parser in Python, they don&amp;rsquo;t go and write one library, they find it on GitHub, which saves their ass. And thereafter, when they create something useful, they return the favor to open source by maintaining projects like React, Angular, etc. So, the question is, why in this world, would any 18-year-old college student would do such thing? What is the value the kid sees? If you promote hardcore open source, 5 out of 1500 would come and 1 would stay. If you promote Google Summer of Code, 400 out of 1500 would come and 30 would stay. And out of those 30, you can definitely be certain that more than 1 would continue doing open source. So, this is what I said to :name-retracted:, &amp;ldquo;This is not a model which we invented for KGP, this is a model which Larry Page and Sergey Brin created in 2004. Even they resorted to money, incentives, and glamour to get more students into open source. We are still young, to solve this problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my perspectives for MetaKGP is the same. It is trying to help students without giving any sustainable incentive, and hoping they would stick together. No, they won&amp;rsquo;t. I still go back to the group because I know that some people in there share the same passion for Software as I do. Why are we not working on developing that passion? Why are we not passionate about creating things anymore? Small things, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, but it should be solving the problem of at least one person. Let us do that! Let us empower more beginners to achieve this. Second years like :name-retracted: and &amp;ldquo;name-retracted: have such bright college life ahead, they do things which less than 1% of their batch would be able to comprehend. This is what we should be doing. And people like :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: are their inspirations when they do these things. The people who inspire them, just don&amp;rsquo;t know how they are helping others without actually willing to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the &amp;ldquo;problem with MetaKGP&amp;rdquo; began when :name-retracted: misunderstood it. He started believing that promoting MetaKGP will solve all the problems because it represents the core concept of Freedom in software and a war against proprietary things (in this case, closed KGP societies and Hall culture). The concept of being open to everyone and hierarchy, all routed his passion towards promoting MetaKGP. It was hard to argue with him because he had forgotten what it feels to be the first year and knowing rat shit about these technologies and ideas. He had lost the concept of being a guide to juniors long time ago and he became a friend to everyone. Alas, that was never going to solve the issue. Willingly or unwillingly, everyone started spreading &amp;ldquo;word&amp;rdquo; about MetaKGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you read :name-retracted:&amp;rsquo;s :article-name-retracted: you will find the motive &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;:exact-words-retracted:&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; For me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration comes when we work together to organize a big event, not one person contacting people to come and speak. Collaboration is when someone messages you &amp;ldquo;I will take care of this&amp;rdquo;, but you insist on sharing the work because you know they would get exhausted by the amount of work involved and they just said it because they are junior to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Openness is when we freely respond to juniors and batchmates &amp;ldquo;Yaar room pe aa ja kabhi bhi; Chal milte hain; Yaha se padh le&amp;rdquo;. Two days ago, I met 3 unknown juniors from RK. They wished to open a startup of memes. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know what GET/POST requests are. I told them everything, how they can use MVC, databases, image editing with js, apps, security of servers. I left them with the suggestion, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t do this if you are aiming for users, do this because you want this product to be alive, do it just for the sake of creating it. Users will follow. And even if they don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;ll never regret the fact of creating something.&amp;rdquo; I spent 2 hours with them and comforted them to approach me anytime in future. I guess that would be openness. I did not add them to KOSS or MetaKGP because it will not help them as of now, and they would probably be a victim of inferiority complex, as a lot of my friends were when I added them to KLUG in my first year. I was different and developed the false belief that this was the correct way and hence it would work for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-improvement is when we read a trending article about git, python, (some particular ML algorithm) even if we know so much about it; because we thrive for that last 20-30% we don&amp;rsquo;t know about it, that particular method or that command. And then we share stuff in places like ShowKGP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity is asking :name-retracted: &amp;ldquo;how is work?&amp;rdquo;, even when your inner self is telling you that you would not get a constructive answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the :name-retracted:&amp;rsquo;s :article-name-retracted:, you can find an article about inclusivity - :exact-words-retracted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, this is a good model. But it will fail when the &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; includes the one &amp;ldquo;who got into the phase of passive lack of exclusion&amp;rdquo;. Again, all I am resorting to is that promoting MetaKGP is a positive, attempt at solving a very difficult, abstract and huge problem in college. But no one ever questioned, should we really be doing that right now? For me, there are more existing problems in KGP which needs to be solved and they hold a higher priority. I have spent a lot of my time in KGP at solving those. You surely know all of it, and all of me in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, this reminds me of the recent movie Newton. It is a great drama which shows us that there is a limit to the extent of solving a problem and strategizing is very important rather than following the pure true way. If you have watched it, you should remember the crazy scene when Rajkumar Rao holds the gun in his hand. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, I can quote a line from the movie &amp;ldquo;Sir, koi bhi change ek din mein nahi aata. Waqt lagta hai&amp;rdquo;. I can totally relate to :name-retracted:&amp;rsquo;s MetaKGP with the lead in the movie, who tries to solve everything instantly by doing it the pure way. Although it solves the problem upto some extent but is completely useless and can be solved in steps, in easier and more sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been writing this email for a long time now, and I think it can never be completed. I&amp;rsquo;ll get some tea now and hope to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. I was listening to Post Rock the whole time. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;name-retracted-responded--&#34;&gt;:name-retracted: responded -&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Himanshu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first place, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be sorry for that. This incident has very little correlation to the cab discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have provided a more than verbose level of description, I would say -vv. And it resonates my own view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:some comments on the previous email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh this mail was such a great relief, few bad things happened these days and then you read a letter like this. I really liked the way you structured the letter, it seems like whatever is written are thoughts which came spontaneously to the mind but analysis which had always been there with ready references. &lt;em&gt;Chuckle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope ki you are going good with the guitar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

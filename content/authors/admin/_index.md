Hello! My name is Himanshu Mishra. I am a Software Engineer at Spotify, living in Stockholm, Sweden.
I graduated from IIT Kharagpur, India.

I spent my college days discovering my affection for Software engineering.
I feel the same way about creating software as I do for creating any kind of art or literature.
A few of my open source projects have ended up with a small community around them.
I spend a lot of time advocating Open Source to people around me.

I have an affection for literature. Reading and Writing are in my weekly routine. I publish [my blog posts](/post) on this website. They are categorized as [Tech](/categories/tech) or [Non-Tech](/categories/non-tech) or sometimes both. Apart from blog posts, I also [write letters](/blog/letters) and make some of them [public](/letters).
